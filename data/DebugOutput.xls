0	3	0	4	4	4	4	0	3	2	3	4	4	I guess I'm one of the lucky ones... because I've have had very few problems with my Transformer Prime.I originally ordered it in early December thru Amazon and was one of the those poor people who's order was cancelled. The whole preorder thing was a fiasco, not only with Amazon but with several other places that had to cancel orders. I put that on Asus, not on Amazon. I was able to place an order with BB that arrived after a lot of confusion and frustration (talked to 4 different CSRs and got 4 different answers) along with the dock (ordered from NewEgg) and received both on December 29. I have been following all the problems that others have had with the Prime and so wanted to wait to review it until I had upgraded with ICS and had confirmed that the GPS, WiFi and Bluetooth were all functioning properly as well as making sure there weren't any other fundamental problems. I have to admit that before the ICS update and another later firmware update, things were a little dicey, especially with the GPS and the fact that I couldn't get my Bluetooth headset to pair with the Prime, but since then the Prime has worked perfectly. I don't really care about the GPS, I have good cell phone GPS and also navigation in my car so it is basically redundant to have GPS on the tablet. I suppose it's the principal of the thing though and I can say that I do get satellites, even indoors and they do lock. I compared the Prime GPS with my smart phone and there was very little difference in connectivity.My biggest complaint is that about 3 days after I received it, I got a scratch on the back cover which was really upsetting...the brushed aluminum is so pretty! It is easily marred so you need to be careful. I have purchased a skin that protects it and also store it in a neoprene case. Lesson learned. The dock really does enhance the Prime experience. I like that it locks very securely with the tablet. Not only does it increase battery use but it has virtually replaced my laptop. The keyboard was a little hard to get used to because of the smaller size and I ended up disabling the touch pad because my sleeve would hit it and send the cursor all over the place. No big loss as I hate all touch pads anyway and I was happy to find a way to get rid of it.The only other issue I had with the Prime was the wall charger. The first few times I used it it got exceedingly hot and although I'm not a techie, this doesn't seem like a good thing. I did some investigating and one of the suggestions was that you put it in a plastic bag and then put it in the freezer for 20 minutes or so. Hmmmm, OK it seemed like kind of stupid way to fix it but I tried it anyway. Well apparently it worked because I haven't had any over-heating problems with it since. Who knew.This was my first tablet and so I went back and forth between the Prime and a iPad. I'm just not one of those "Apple love" people and feel like Apple products are over rated and over priced. I have a iPod Touch 4Gen that I like very much but hate the paranoid way that Apple and iTunes are so restrictive so I really didn't want to get into that with the iPad. I'm glad I opted for the Prime. I got 2x the storage for the same price and I like that I can use SD and Micro SD cards for additional storage. Also like the USB connection so that I can use a mouse. I like the Android OS. I have it on my phone and it is really intuitive and easy to use...same with ICS on the Prime. There are plenty of apps available.The Prime has exceeded my expectations. I love it and use it constantly. I'm very glad I invested the money.	
1	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	1	4	4	Amazon has delivered to the best of their ability. I work for Apple and play with iPad 2s on a regular basis. To put it simply: they have made me detest the very concept of tablets. I played with this tablet for 30 minutes and fell in love. It was the perfect Christmas gift for myself for all the hours I've been putting in but to my surprise, all those hours came to bite me in the arse. I get home one day and read news of preorders available. Product pages with active order options suddenly disappear from nearly every online retailer.Well not all. I found one after much scavenging of the internets and preordered a 32 GB model on the 26th of November, only to discover TODAY that the retailer's stock would not come in until January 8th.So thank you, Amazon, for lowering the expectation of shipment date and preventing any further orders when the supply did not meet the demand. Customers who expected a timely shipment of their units received $10 gift card codes and were given an adjusted shipment date while others who were of the first fortunate batch have already received their Primes. I know now to never second guess my natural tendency to want to order items from Amazon.But really, Amazon, 4 weeks? I know you can do better than THAT.	
2	3	4	4	3	4	3	4	3	2	2	4	4	Better than the iPad 2. I just opened my Prime a few days ago, and I am already in love with it. My wife has an iPad 2 that she also got recently, and while I am impressed by both devices, the Prime has won me over with its insane processor speed and beautiful display. The seamless integration with my google account is also a plus - my apps began downloading right away, and after I logged into my google account, all of my wireless access points were instantly available, so I didn't have to log in to wifi manually once I got home. As for the iPad 2, we had to plug it into the computer to sync for a few hours before getting to use it, and after all that we discovered that our apple accounts had gotten confused, so the iPad had a weird mix of apps from two different accounts, most of which were solely meant for the iPhone, so the screen resolution was off. Surprisingly, the Prime was easier to set up than the iPad 2 (I've usually found apple products to be very intuitive).Another thing that impressed me are the speakers in the Prime. I played some music and it sounded great. The Prime is also thinner than the iPad 2. I believe the processor is faster as well (it sure feels like it).After playing with each, I just feel like there is so much more that I can do with my Prime than with the iPad 2. My apps and games look better on the Prime, even the ones that were designed for phone use. When I am using it, I really get the feeling that Asus went all out to give us the best experience imaginable at this point in technology. The iPad 2 is cool, but it's not as nice as my Prime.	
3	3	4	4	3	4	2	4	2	4	3	4	4	Best android tablet right now, period. I have had this unit for more than 2 weeks now, along with the docking station.  while there were definitely some initial bugs to work out, this is a powerhouse of a tablet. the hardware speaks for itself, currently there is no tablet out there that can touch the performance.  As further optimizations are made for the hardware, it will really start to separate itself from the current crop of tablets.To me the sleekness of the tablet coupled with how solid it feels is definitely a plus.  the colors are stylish and the brushed finish is almost elegant.Some of the early run units had some issues,  some people reported dead pixels, light bleed, GPS issues,  and wifi issues.  my very early unit did have GPS issues the latest update seems to have fixed that issue with my unit.  I compared wifi with the original transformer and the Xoom, and the signal strength was comparable.Ice Cream sandwich is due to be released for thus tablet on the 12th,  I believe that will only make this tablet a stronger choice in what is becoming a crowded field.A lot has been made of the fact that android platform has fewer apps, but I must say that in my 2 years of using android,  I have yet to not be able to find an app for whatever it is I am wanting to do.A big outcry from the developer community, which I an a part of,  was about the locked bootloader making it impossible to root this tablet.  while it may affect only a very small percentage of users who would want to void there warranty, it is important to many power users.  Asus has now come out and said they will unlock the for those want it.  many of the negative reviews on here are due to the campaign by power users to get Asus to unlock it.overall, if you are looking for an android tablet, you will not go wrong with the Prime.	
4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	4	0	3	4	Most of my concerns were unfounded. Update 1/11/12: Well, I promised an update when ICS was released but unfortunately my Prime has the dreaded "Serial Number Unknown" issue, and can't be updated OTA. I had to return it to Best Buy, and there are no more in stock. I still like the Prime, and plan on getting my hands on another one as soon as possible. Be advised though. There seem to be a lot of Primes being shipped with this major issue. :(------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:I've had a chance to play with the Asus Transformer Prime for a few days now, and I'm very impressed. I was going to wait until next week when the Android 4 ICS update comes out, but I decided to give a brief review in it's current stage.First Impressions: Out of the box, the Prime has the look and feel of quality built tablet. The thinness really surprised me since my other tablets are at least twice as thick. Before doing anything, I charged the Prime fully. The first boot took about 90 seconds. My Prime came with firmware .27, which I updated to the latest .33. After updating and getting everything setup, the Prime would boot in under a minute.Screen: Simply put, it's bright and beautiful. I do not have any noticeable light bleeding.Wifi: This is where I was most concerned. My concerns seem to be unfounded. My Wifi works fine. My router (an older FiOS Actiontec "G") is located on the 2nd floor. I get a good signal throughout my house, including my basement. Throughput is fine, and my connection never drops.GPS: First let me say that I could care less about this because I'll never use my Prime not connected to Wifi, but for the purposes of this review, I did test it. The first test was indoors, and as expected the results were not good. I could get an occasional satellite lock, but it would disconnect. I then went outside and I made sure Wifi was disabled. With a clear view of the sky, the Prime got a satellite lock in around 30 seconds. The GPS seems to work fairly well if you're outdoors and have a clear view of the sky. It remained locked, and Google Maps knew exactly where I was. Depending on your plans for the GPS, it is a mixed bag. If you're planning on using it for navigation in your vehicle, you'll probably be disappointed. If you want to use it outdoors with apps such as Google Maps, or Google Sky Map, then it works OK.Battery: Battery life was good. My first charge lasted about 8 hours. After some tweaking and subsequent charges, I now get around 10 hours.Cameras: The 8MP rear camera has 1080P video capture and is a great performer. It takes excellent pictures in good light, and is the best I've seen on an Android tablet or phone. I haven't taken much video, but from what I have taken, it looks very good.  The front 1.2MP camera is perfect for video conferencing, etc.Performance: Performance is excellent as expected. The Tegra 3 doesn't disappoint even though most apps aren't optimized for it. All the apps I use open noticeably faster than my Tegra 2 based tablet. The screen is quick and responsive, and I haven't noticed any lag. I use Dolphin HD as my browser, and the stock keyboard. There is the occasional "app crash", but this is almost always related to Android 3 "Honeycomb", not the Prime's hardware. The vast majority of current apps are written for compatibility with phones and Android 2.x, not the "tablet only" Android 3.x. In 2012, Android 4.x "ICS" will solve this problem, as the same operating system will once again be used for both new phones and new tablets.Overall: I'm completely satisfied. Wifi was my only real concern, and it works just fine for me. The Asus Transformer Prime looks beautiful, and is blazing fast. My only caveat would be if the GPS is very important to you. Since its limitations appear to be hardware related, I wouldn't expect any major improvements to it. I'll update my review when the Android 4.x ICS update comes out next week, and when/if Asus makes any major improvements/fixes.	
5	4	2	4	3	4	1	1	4	0	4	2	0	What could have been. Fit and finish are top notch, rivaling the iPad without a doubt. Light weight, the microSD and micro HDMI ports are great for adding storage or hooking your tablet into the big screen to show videos or pictures or even watch a movie.This could have been the "iPad killer" but a fatal design flaw did this product in... the all aluminum backing really hurts the wifi connectivity (and the GPS but that didn't bother me so much). The signal strength would fluctuate constantly while parked in the same spot regardless of how close or far from the AP you sat.The nail in the coffin though was Asus announcing at CES this week the next generation Prime due out in Q2 of this year, which has a higher screen resolution but is also redesigned for "better wif and GPS capabilities." They essentially admitted a design flaw in the first generation Prime and are promptly coming out with the next generation. The people that bought this and are outside the return period are basically stuck with a product released a month ago and is already outdated and has a major design flaw.I returned this to Best Buy today after 15 days of ownership and will never purchase another Asus product given the way they run their business. Product design issues, inventory delays, and out-dating their own product within 3 weeks of launch does will not create new or keep existing customers. The TF700 is what should have been launched 3 weeks ago, not this beta tester which I am sure they will be getting back in droves.	
6	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	3	0	2	0	0	GPS is Useless. Loved the transformer but just returned it.  I really wanted to use it in my car as a GPS device.  My wife was excited about using it as a Navigator and Point of interest finder while I did the driving.  The big screen would make the experience much easier than looking at a tiny cell phone screen.  Unfortunately,ASUS screwed up the design of the unit and the metal backing blocks the GPS signals.When I was in Vegas last week the Prime kept insisting we were in Ohio!I think if you are paying premium prices for a tablet, everything should work on it.So I returned it.  The good news is that ASUS will have a new unit out in 2nd quarter that will have a plastic back.  This will eliminate the GPS and WI-Fi issues.  I will repurchase it then.Other problems:  Every video I've tried from my collection. (movies TV shows etc) had to be converted to a special format in order to play on the Prime.  My PC can play dozens of formats why can't the Prime?	
7	3	4	4	0	4	3	0	2	4	4	4	4	Works great for me! I have had my prime since Christmas so I have had a lot of time to use it and form an opinion.  While the wifi signal indicator doesn't always show a strong signal, it connects as fast or faster than my iPad according to speedtest.net.  I agree that web browsing with the stock browser was not very impressive in the beginning.  I downloaded Dolphin which was better the stock and then Opera which was much faster.  Well everything changed when ICS was installed on my prime.  The stock browser is now very fast and responsive.  For that matter, everything seems much faster.  I have to say I am very surprised with the Android operating system.  This is my first go around with it and all I heard was how unstable it is vs. IOS.  So far it has been just as stable as IOS but with a lot more options and features.  I do agree that what ASUS did with the GPS is crappy and the fact they already announced a replacement Prime stinks but I am still very happy with my current Prime since I wasn't planning on using it for a GPS anyways.***UPDATE***The GPS issue is fixed.  They pushed an update yesterday to fix the GPS and the GPS worked perfectly on my way to work!	
8	1	3	4	4	2	3	3	4	0	4	2	1	works fine for me. I'm not really that surprised the reviews that the tablet has gotten. But not all of it its bad which is why I'm taking my time and writing a review.I purchased this tablet on January 1st from gamestop and received it on the 12th. When I first got it I was impressed with how fast the tablet booted up and how fast the applications came up!. It has a very beautiful screen and the colors are amazing. The wifi I had no problems with but I didn't put much thought into it because I was only feet away from my router. I went downstairs to see if I could receive any signal and that where the disappointment came in. I could barely hold any connection and when it did it was very slow. I was extremely disappointed and even more so since I bought it from gamestop and once you open it you're stuck with it. Out of curiosity I powered down to see if that would help  since after the update to ICS I didn't do so and to my surprised it actually worked! I was able to get wifi signal in the first floor (router is in the second) and it managed to stay connected where before it would disconnect me. I even tried it from my car and it still received wifi signal. Right now I'm at the laundry mat which has a wifi hotspots and Im connected with any problem. I do notice the bars going up and down but that hasn't affected my connection speed.I haven't tried the GPS yet but I'm not too worried about it since I didn't purchase this tablet for the GPS. The games run smoothly and like mentioned it is a very fast tablet. That's not saying it doesn't have any flaws. I have noticed that sometimes I get "browser is not responding" pop up and I'm writing this review from the tablet and when I pick a spot to either add or correct it goes to a different place in the sentence. If anyone has any tips on how to fix that please help!!I gave the tablet 3 stars because while overall I'm happy with my purchase i however do not like how ASUS is dealing with the issues people are experiencing. If we are paying $600 for a product we either expect the product to be fully functioning and/or have full support from the company. Selling a newer product mere weeks when the newer one is out while ignoring the issues the current model has and STILL selling said product is NOT the way to go about things. I hope they plan to compensate those that are having issues somehow.For those that are planning to get the prime be careful with going by every review out there. The tablet has a few bugs yes but I'm nit having the wifi issues some are having. I would recommend buying it from somewhere you can return it just in case you're unhappy. I lucked out that my tablet works pretty well.. otherwise I would have gotten stuck with something I was unhappy with thanks to gamestop return policy.	
9	2	2	4	4	1	4	0	0	1	4	0	0	Asus lost my business forever. Well Asus has lost my business forever and possibly Amazon also for that matter for allowing a crap product like this to be released. It seems to me and I understand that there are bad units during production but to have 90% of the units go out and ship to customers when it was a known problem back in Nov. I'm not sure what Asus was thinking that customers would just ignore the fact that there product just doesn't work as advertised and forget about it is... well I can't think of the words I'm trying to come up here. Asus... good bye and good luck to your future if you have one. Your a lieing ass cheap no tech support company. At least admit it for once.Andy.	
10	3	4	4	3	4	1	0	4	1	4	4	4	Awesome! I have only messed with it for a few hours but I love it.  It is much better than the other tablets that I have messed with. Ice Cream Sandwich is great I think that it will be a big advantage over honeycomb.	
11	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	0	3	3	4	4	Great Tablet. I was worried after reading all the reviews and maybe just lucky - but my Transformer Prime is fantastic. I have not used the GPS and do not care about this feature. The wireless access is fine. The tablet updated at once to Ice Cream Sandwich. I also have the keyboard and the combination is great. I am hoping to get them for my whole office staff.	
12	3	3	4	0	4	1	4	4	4	3	3	4	I don't ususally review products. I've had prime (tabby) for about 30 days.  In that time I can say I've gotten lots of compliments on a great screen, and build design, several people went to buy one after seeing mine.  The Tegra 3 is a beast, this is the first tablet that's closer to a computer and less like a phone in part due to the power provided by the Tegra 3.  Now its up to software designers to release "real" software, like dreamweaver and all of the creative suite.  I love typing on this thing, landscape is great for two hands, portrait allows you to type with two thumbs.  The viewing angles are excellent and important as part of the reason for such a tablet is for sales.  The micro hdmi out port provides a useful setup for meetings.The wifi is as good as any other device I own and significantly better than the droid x.  I believe the diversity antennas do a good job.  However the GPS on my unit is completely useless even in wide open outdoor areas. I have set up my phone to tether GPS data to the tabby although I don't utilize it often (ever) for navigation.  UPDATE: ASUS to provide free GPS dongles to all, and improved RF after the C3 models.ICS on this sandwich is awesome, very stable.  Able to multitask seamlessly.  The browser still needs work - I think a high performance mode would be useful. I toggle plugins on demand and tabby does a great job.  The resolution seems more than adequate for me although if a tf201- tf700 upgrade path was made available I might consider it.  ICS kills ad-hoc networking beware.  Tethered with an LTE device this thing flies.The construction is slvete, connections will leave some exposure and I often baby the device by not using it while charging.  BTW the batteries are excellent.  I will say that there is a slight click if I press down on several areas of the screen and/or back.  Nothing to make me send it back, but something I will look out for.  I got the dock some time later.  Didn't think I'd use it, but I was wrong.  It turns this thing into a highend ultrabook.I have to say I'm surprised how much I enjoy and use tabby.  I am a little disappointed with how much personal information google tries to digest.  Really google you need to know all my applications even the ones I installed on my own?  Really, Google I can't delete or reset that information.  Really google I can't stop using Google Play because half of my apps are authenticated through it, but I'm getting really close to deleting my account-- I'm not sure that will stop google from compiling data on you though, just in different ways.	
13	4	3	4	4	3	3	3	2	4	2	3	4	Best android tablet out there, however... I've been using an Ipad2 for the past few months but was eyeing the prime since it was announced last year.  They finally had one in stock at my local BestBuy and I picked it up over this past weekend with the BB Gift Cards i've been dying to use from Xmas.First Impressions:Likes:- Incredibly well constructed with great fit and finish.- Gorgeous screen.  Deep blacks with great contrast.  However, I wouldn't say it's head and shoulders above the Ipad2 screen.  Just brighter with higher resolution.- Very snappy with the ICS upgrade.- Great eye candy with the games designed specifically for Tegra3.- I did not experience the Wifi or GPS issue.  I got full wifi signal with the router approximately 15 - 20ft away and the GPS locked my exact location when i'm next to the window in my apartment.- Solid camera performance for pics and videos (Blackberry playbook still blows away both the Prime and the Ipad2 in that category.  Surprising)Dislikes:- It really boggles the mind how Asus would put the only speaker in a position where your hand will cover it up perfectly.  It truly is a WTF?  However, sound quality is acceptable but not as good as the Ipad 2.- Still not as buttery smooth as the Ipad, especially when comparing the browser.  It seems Apple just got it right with the perfect fluidity when scrolling a web page.  The prime brower is just a wee bit slower than the Ipad's and does lock up intermittenly as other users pointed out.- Not a whole lot of tablet specific apps in the Marketplace.  Very dissappointing considering these android browsers have been around for over a year.  And the few tablet apps that i was able to compare side by side with the Ipad2 (not counting the games designed for the Tegra3), Ipad 2 wins hands down in polish and performance.- The thing is a bit unwieldly to hold.  Since it's so wide, you'll want to use in in landscape mode for everything but it really isn't that comfortable to hold for long periods of time.  Hand fatigue sets in pretty quick.Overall, i'm satisfied with the tablet.  It's a great piece of hardware (minus the laughably bad speaker placement) but let's hope that more developers jump on the ICS tablet bandwagon.  The tiny tablet app selection is quite sad.  As a result, I can't ditch the Ipad2 as originally planned.	
14	0	1	3	4	0	1	4	2	4	1	2	0	Asus customer service  - SLOW - finally back - hope it keeps working. I finally got the tablet back and it appears to be working as it should. It was a gift for my wife and she seems pleased. Time will tell how it works out. Still disapointed that it was a dud when it first arrived and I am still disappointed that I had to wait for the "repairs". Asus should have shipped me a new unit when problems started.  =====I ordered the tablet back in December - 2011  knowing it would not arrive until January - 2012. The tablet arrived - I read the very simplistic information provided. Charged the unit overnight and then tried to confugure it. The unit would not connect to my wireless network. I checked the wireless net and it was working fine with my laptop and phones. The tablet had problems and without a wireless connection you are out of luck. I sent back the unit to Asus - I should of sent the unit back to Amazon for a refund - lesson learned. I still don't have the tablet back from Asus as of 2-10-2012 and it was sent back in January. Asus told me they had to order a part for the unit.  Bottom line if the unit fails just send it back to Amazon and don't mess around with Asus and if you have to use the Asus customer service - good luck.

This tablet rocks it is lightning fast u can get all firmware updates now and run ice cream sandwich  the camera is amazing great pics I'm finding myself using it for everything great product i am in 16 x 80 manufactured home at far end of house and get great wifi signal i do have wndr 3700 n600 net gear router though  i didn't buy for GPS so i couldn't tell you  i also tether to phone  i have also used friends ipad2 it by far runs smoother and graphics r better and he agrees and he paid more money  this tablet is the reason apple is comming out with ipad 3 asus has set the new standard	
16	4	3	4	3	4	3	4	0	3	4	3	4	Lois. This tablet is totally useful.  Am an IPad user so android apps take some getting used to but everything about the tablet is wonderful.  The quality of the screen and the fast operating system.  The only thing this doesn't have is all ways to get to the Internet from every where.  Must be wi fi.A bit unhappy with Asus for taking so long to make the keyboard available.	
17	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	2	4	0	4	4	The transformer prime> New ipad(3) still #1 tablet. well it's true. Yes you have 4g but woohoo i have a phone with 4g no loss here. The prime has so many features and can handle pc games(stream over wifi) and the controls are top notch. It has bluetooth you can use your mouse/wireless keyboard to make it feel like a laptop. This thing is ultra fast. I choose this over the ipad 2 and ever since I've had it I used my laptop less. I get about 10 hours of web browsing a day. Get this if you want something sleek and fast and has lots of power in a slim device.	
18	4	4	4	3	2	1	4	3	2	4	3	4	great upgrade from the original! but... Had the o.g. version now I've had the prime for about a week and all I can say is WOW. OK this one is a total upgrade n not just1 or 2 things. For instance on my t f 101 adding slot of Widgets more then 20 apparently would slow it down significantly. Now I have multiple Widgets on each page no problem. I love the Flash on the camera! Pics have crazy good quality and also it's not slow as hell like on the transformer. I love that my tablet vibrates  u mite not but I do lol. The games dedicated for the tegra 3 are a lil pricy but if ur in it for the games there actually worth it. GTA is just like ps2  the graphics on the new games are quite impressive. Tablet kinda sucks to hold when playing it's like super thin and sharp so it digs into your hands some times.  But still an improvement non the less. I like that u can manually close apps now. The speakers are definitely better but not super loud. Oooo! I really don't like how when I plug the charger and the HDMI cable up due to the ergonomics of the tablet the connections stick out. Like they don't look totally secure and slot of times my HDMI cable unattaches.  O yea and it sucks that my old keyboard doesn't work with this one. And right now they keyboards are running a lil under $200. Overall this is a bad ass tablet. Now that it seems Asus has fixed their biggest issue functionality. I've had no problems SO FAR... and with the transformer that was the biggest issue. Prime is super smooth and reacts way better then the tf101.  my advice for people comparing iPad 2 to the prime.  If u got an iPhone and u want a bigger version get iPad 2 or hd but if kinda bored with apple products and want something super customizable and has slot less restrictions go with the prime. Not the transformer tho because iPad 2 is better than that.	
19	4	4	3	4	4	4	0	2	4	4	4	4	Fantastic. I absolutely love my Asus Transformer Prime.  I initially went to purchase an ebook but when I saw the Prime, there was no decision.  I also purchased the keypad to which it docks.  A great tool that I take everywhere and use everyday.Frank	
20	4	3	3	3	2	4	3	4	2	3	4	4	Don't hesitate - buy one now! Initially, I was somewhat wary of Android but after weeks of research I decided to buy this tablet. It came with ICS  - Android 4.0x, 32 GB version. I won't boar you with the beauty and aesthetics of the unit - it lives up to all of that. The speed of the tablet is unreal (Tegra 3 - 4/5 cores). It is so fast to respond to screen touch - no lag.  I have not experienced any issues with the wireless network coverage that seemed to plague some of the earlier units - so these later units seem to have addressed the issue. There is a massive amount of applications available.  I would recommend buying a stylus - just saves the screen smudging and makes selecting small text easier than using fat fingers.  Here is what amazed me :  I switched it on, fiddled around with some of the features and looked at "Mynet".  It discovered all my DLNA devices - like the Windows media server and my Bluray players.  So I picked a movie clip from the server and when I went to play it the TF201 asked if I wanted to display it locally (on the tablet) or on my Bluray player. I selected the Bluray player and the TV burst into life.  It's awesome!Why I like it more than the iPad.  Like the iPad it's aimed at end users / the consumer market - but the TF201 can be extensively customized. The cameras are great - just dragging the focus area around is so cool. Movie playback is crisp and clear. Screen handling is fast and responsive and zooming in is just the usual process of pushing fingers apart. I had preconceived ideas that I would not want to use it like regular PC - but I have been using it like a tablet - and for everything else I would use a PC for - including video conferencing on Skype.  If you want to type long winded reviews then yes, use a PC or get the fabulous docking station (just ordered it). It folds flat, extends battery life to 18 hours, has 2 USB slots and a standard sized SD card.Although the 700 model is due out with it's incredible higher res screen sometime (higher res than the iPad HD)in 2Q you won't be disappointed with the TF201 which already has a beautiful screen.Eco-System : iPad has a much bigger after market for accessories in retail stores. Having one current model makes it easier to produce standard sized accessories. You may struggle to find accessories for Android tablets in retail stores because each device has front / back cameras, memory slots, connection ports, etc in different locations - so cases in general are device specific. However, there is a wealth of accessories for the myriad of Android tablets like this Asus tab on-line.In summary - Android is so user friendly, rock solid and flexible.  The Asus' power and performance makes it a winning combination.  I have bags under my eyes  - staying up so late - I can't leave the Asus alone!Update July 3.  We were so impressed we bought another one to stop the arguments about who gets to use it.	
21	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	in love. I am loving this tablet!  I am having trouble finding a cover/case i like... but LOVE it!!! Its so fast and small and THIN! My 2 and 3 year old love it also!	
22	4	2	3	4	3	1	0	3	4	1	4	4	Best Value. I have nothing bad to say about this product directly at all. As soon as I got it in, I hooked it up to my WiFi Network. Had issues, but no biggie I knew there was a bug. Then connected it to my phone (I turned my phone to a mobile hot spot), connedected to the internet, then updated the firmware automagically.Battery life is awesome... I use it for school, work, and play.Memory is awesiome....Graphics are sick!!!!Didja know you can plug your USB X box controller into the USB slot and play games with it.... No configuration required!The keyboard docking station is a must have... it's another battery pack!!!!!Now for my complaints (relax, it's not about the hardware):  This awsome product performs better than the IPad. It leaves the Xoom, and Galaxy in the dust. Where the heck are the accesories? There aren't enough after market products for the Prime. Not that it needs alot, but the lack of skins, and rather small collection of cases is killing me.Asus: WTF on the shipping and advertisement? I understand that many people didn't think this product was going to be such a big hit, but I didn't know about the xbox controller until after I got it and I did PLENTY of research. I ordered in Feb, and got it in March.I'm thinking if Asus marketed this thing better, more people would know about it. More companies would create accesories for it.BTW, the Micro HDMI cord was a great investmet. micro HDMI cord + xbox wired controller + hd TV + shadowgun = a damn good video game system.	
23	2	3	2	0	4	4	3	2	4	2	1	1	Wifi does not work...no internet connection. I recieved my ASUS Transformer Prime yesterday afternoon and after opening it I left it to charge up fully.  This morning I removed the tablet from the charger and powered it up for the first time.  While the display is beautiful and the camera seems more then adequate the Wifi will not connect to anything rendering internet, email and everything else associated with connecting to the internet inoperable.  I telephoned ASUS TP support and after explaining the issue I was forwarded to the Wifi specialists division.  I was on hold for exactly 3 hours 43 minutes before I could no longer ignore the various other calls coming in.  This is frustrating.  Obviously the Wifi specialists division of the ASUS Transformer Prime tablet is overwhelmed with calls or they may have found time to answer my on-hold call.  So, to date I have a tablet which looks beautiful but does not work and I have already wasted nearly 4 hours of the first 12 hours I have owned the tablet sitting on hold with Technical support.  I will give feedback after I have either corrected this issue or returned the tablet out of frustration.  As a side note, the charging cord seems cheap but the Tablet itself feels like it is very solidly made and appealing in style.  Right now that makes it a very stylish paper weight. 1 star rating because I can't give it less!UPDATE!!!  I was able to fix the tablet by doing a Factory reset X 3 and voila...it works.  ASUS customer service is still very poor, I ended up waiting on the phone another 2 hours after work and while sitting on the phone I recieved an email from ASUS online support recommending a Factory reset.  There were no directions included with the product on how to execute a factory reset but after another couple minutes of searching I found the directions.  The factory reset worked and now the Wifi works.  One interesting tidbit, while searching for an answer to my Wi-Fi problem I encountered an article describing how to increase the Wifi signal.  Based on the locations of the Wifi antenna's within the tablet you simply squeeze on the glass firmly and voila...my wifi signal immediately jumped from 1 bar to a full signal reception.  I haven't had a chance to do much else but at a minimum the tablets wifi is now working and updating to ICS as we speak.  I still give it 2 stars for Customer Service but will update the review again based on further inspection.	
24	4	4	3	4	3	1	4	3	0	3	3	4	Great for movies and books. My wife and I love this thing.  It has great graphics for books and videos.  The screen does seem to get dirty with finger prints, but the included cloth does a nice job of cleaning the screen.	
25	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	3	0	4	4	4	I'm commenting from this device now! This thing is so amazing that if it could have babies, I would have babies with it.  I'm not even joking.  Best tablet ever.  I have no complaints whatsoever.	
26	2	4	4	4	3	2	3	4	4	0	4	4	Perfection... I am an IT and long time Asus fan. I've owned many laptops, desktops, phones, ect. By far this is top 3 best purchases I have ever made (Docking station included.) The tablet has no limit and the Android market is full of apps.I can't compare this to any tablets because it is the first for me to own. I didn't want to go with the standard APPLE iPad because I am discontent with their products. After doing a lot of research this baby by far topped the charts for what I was looking for.Cons:-Minor complaint about the Amethyst. I am not a fan of the color but I couldn't buy it in the Silver/Champagne because I'd hate for it to get confused with an iPad.Pros:-Great for trips! I am in the Navy and I take this thing every time we go underway. It's full of apps and with the docking station I can plug in my external hard drive and watch videos to keep me entertained.-Compact. It fits in the smallest of nooks and with the limited space I have it works much better than my 17.3in laptop.-Superb battery life-Wifi works. Some users have reported Wifi and GPS issues. I haven't experienced any issues with Wifi other than distance. I didn't expect this thing to have a OMG SUPER AMAZING wireless card. As far as GPS goes I haven't used it.-Media plays flawlessly on this tablet.-Filesystem. You are able to access the file system and move apps, photos, music, videos, games, ect. around freely without a "jailbreak."As an Asus fanboy I am quite pleased with the product. The only issue I have is the color but I bought it knowing that. It was fixed with the case and I can always buy a skin for it.	
27	3	4	3	4	4	4	0	3	2	2	4	4	No Need To Fear. I purchased the Asus Transformer Prime two weeks ago and I am delighted. Having had a long history with iPads I was concerned that the Asus quality or performance might not match-up. I was also concerned because of the often discussed Wi-Fi and GPS issues with the Prime. But once I received and had it in my hands I could tell that much of those concerns were unfounded. The Asus Transformer Prime performs just as well as my iPad ever did. You can point to specs and bench-marking data to define those things that are not perceivable to the naked eye if you want to, but I am certain that most folks will never see or feel the difference. After using an iPad for many years I can honestly tell you there is not one thing I can not do with the Transformer Prime that I could do with my iPad. There is no limitation on available apps and the Transformer Prime even has a setting that will not allow you to accidentally install up proven apps... unless you want to (something iPads will not let you do). While ALL tablets can not be considered a full-blown computer or laptop experience, the Transformer Prime is as close as you can get. One of the primary differences between an iPad and the Transformer is that you have the ability to do REAL file management. Download files move them to new or existing folders, share the same file with multiple apps and move copy and paste files as needed. I also purchased the Keyboard Dock and it too is wonderfully made and perfectly functional. The quality and the workmanship on this product is excellent and I am so glad I went with the Prime and got the beautiful metal finish. There is indeed a GPS issue and you will need to order the free GPS dongle. The Wi-Fi issue is over blown, at least for me, I have not had any issues at all with Wi-Fi the connection strength "perhaps" fluctuates from time to time but I have not notice any issues with performance based on the Wi-Fi.  I have had to do a reboot (reboot is very quick)on it a few times because of some quirky behavior but its not like I did not have to do the same thing from time-to-time with my iPad.From a user standpoint I see the Asus Transformer Prime as an iPad equal. Yes the display is not 400 times better than your HD TV but I challenge you to notice the difference when you have it in your hands. The speed and responsiveness is equal to if not exceeds my iPad. I can recommend the Asus Transformer Prime without hesitation.	
28	3	4	3	4	4	2	4	3	1	4	2	4	still can't play Facebook games. I bought this as a replacement to the iPad (1) for my wife, who loves her iPad except that it doesn't do Flash, or Facebook games.  While I must say that we both think it is a nice tablet, with better specs than the first iPad, we consider it a failed purchase.She just wanted an iPad like device that would do Flash, including Facebook games.  While this tablet does do some flash, apparently it isn't enough.  Many sites still don't work, and certainly the Facebook games don't work at all.The jury is still out as to whether or not we'll return it.  It is an upgrade in all the ways she doesn't care about, and it doesn't have GoodReader.	
29	3	2	4	3	4	3	4	4	1	3	3	2	One of the Better Novelty Tablets. I'm not slamming this tablet.  I'm just pointing out some flaws of most tablets for those that may not know what they're getting themselves into.It's one of the better tablets out there but tablets are still a novelty item.  They have their uses but they definitely aren't notebook replacements and have a place where you don't want to wield a notebook.  Overall it's a good addition to my device collection but my Dell Inspiron Duo provides a better "real web" experience because it has a real desktop OS.  The color doesn't look gray to me but what a champagne would look like.  I've never seen a champagne in person and I've verified the model numbers in store as well and they say gray.I've used the Android OS since the HTC G1 came out and have every major version up through 4.x.  Once mobile Flash was finally introduced, pocket web browsing became a much better experience.  The worst thing about stock Android is they never fixed their e-mail client (no, I don't use their gmail and use an ISP) and it still has the same basic problems since the beginning.  They obviously don't care since they want you to use gmail.The apple crowd have it worse with the lack of flash support but everyone hates being redirected to a mobile site when they've paid good money on a capable machine.  Changing the UserAgent usually doesn't work much these days.  Some sites provide you the option to go to the full site but many don't.  And some sites want you to download a stupid application for a web site.  Hmmm, I just want one web browser for every web site I visit, not an application for every web site I would visit.  I don't need the appcrap kind sir.  The googletv falls into this category as well.I also don't enjoying going to YouTube and getting a notification that the video is not allowed to play on my mobile device.  It's bad enough we get notifications that the video isn't allowed in your country.  Some streaming web sites will also give you the 'no mobile devices allowed'.And the applications.  Everything I ever downloaded for the Android platform has been free and I like it that way.  Maybe I deserve what I get for not paying for the full version but I'm sure that's not the case.  One size does not fit all...installer beware.  Because of the splintering between manufacturers and wireless carries (talking versions) on all these mobile devices, not everything works the way it should or even at all.  The same goes for OS updates.  If you're on a telephone then you're pretty much at the mercy of your wireless provider and what they determine the shelf life of your 3-6 month product.  Good luck getting updates up through your 2 year plan.  Tablets are another story if they're WiFi only models.  Good luck with the vendor.  At least Asus has been okay thus far but I'm sure we've seen the better days of updates.  What if Microsoft didn't provide you Windows Updates after owning your shiny new Packard Bell for 9 months?Oh how I hate virtual keyboards for anything more than inputting passwords....Complex passwords?  Fugetaboutit!!  I picked up the keyboard for this and it's a lifesaver for typing.  I'd like to see Microsoft Surface users enjoying their spreadsheets with a touchscreen.  I'm looking forward to the Surface platform because if it solves the issues I state above, so long Android.Life's Connected Rules:You shouldn't tote around any mobile telephone with a screen size larger than 4".  That's why you have tablets.You shouldn't carry around a tablet with a screen size larger than 10".  That's why you have notebooks.You shouldn't lug around notebooks with a screen size larger than 15".  That's why you have desktops.Big boys play games on desktops with resolutions better than 1920x1080 HDTV resolutions.	
30	4	3	2	0	3	0	1	3	4	0	0	0	Super poor customer support. I don't even know where you start, I guess with the pros.Pro: It performs very well when running apps.Cons: NO GPS lock.- DO NOT USE THE ASUS UNLOCK TOOL. Using it will void both your software AND hardware warranty, you know, because the GPS works soooooo well before you use the unlock tool.- You can get a free GPS dongle. Which adds a huge bulge to your otherwise slick tablet. Again, you must register your tablet before a certain date to get the dongle for free, and you MUST NOT have used the ASUS unlock tool.- The one I bought had the screen coming unglued on one side. Now, my particular seller was amazing and took the tablet back due to the manufacturer defect, but I won't be buying this model of tablet ever...or anything else from ASUS...ever.	
31	3	4	3	4	4	1	4	3	4	2	4	4	Great Tablet. Great device.  It is fast, responsive, great on battery life, and feels great in your hands.  Sure it may have issues with GPS, but that is a minor fault.  WiFi is pretty good, just a bit below perfect since it is only 2.4MHz and not 5.0Mhz.  It is still very quick and the graphics are very fast for games.  Also, it charges super quick.  Probably in half the time of an iPad and with similar battery life.	
32	2	0	1	4	4	3	2	3	4	4	3	4	Great Tablet, But Apparently Gray-Market - Avoid My Seller. I got mine from ElectroBrands, in Brooklyn.  The first clue was a call the next day (how did they get my phone #?) from ElectroBrands stating the warehouse was out of them and would I accept a display model?  It had all of the accessories, but had been in a display case and he would throw in a 5-year store warranty as a bonus (Really?).  After asking how old it was I accepted (I wanted the latest hardware revision to minimize WiFi/GPS problems).  I got a tracking number the day after I ordered it, but the unit did not ship for another week.  When it came it was in a generic box without owner's manual or ASUS warranty card.  When I asked for the original owner's manual and warranty card, I was told I could download them online and register it at the ASUS site.  When I asked again, I got a CD-ROM in the mail.While the tablet is great, This is NOT what I wanted or what was advertised (NIB).This is a fast, smooth easy to use tablet.  I bought it for my son to use in college.  He wants to complain about the WiFi being flaky, but it downloads and installs apps faster than my Razr M at my house (and my laptops, too, I think).  I think he's reading the reviews and having psychosomatic pains!  He says it will run about 8 hours in Performance Mode.  He watches a lot of YouTube stuff.I researched the tablet before I bought it and found it on the ASUS global site, but not the US site.  I really didn't think much about that at the time, assuming the TF701 was the newest US model and maybe I was getting a deal.Buy the US model TF701 to be sure you have a warranty.	
33	1	2	4	3	3	2	4	2	3	4	0	0	Wish I could get my money back. I spent $500 on a tablet where the wifi barely works.This will be the last time I buy the first gen model of any tech.	
34	4	4	2	4	4	1	4	1	4	4	3	4	Gift for the Wife. Extremely well balanced tablet.  No, not top shelf, but didn't have to pay top shelf prices either.  Great resolution, descent battery life.  Wife has had it for close to a month and loves it.	
35	4	4	4	3	4	0	1	4	2	3	4	4	quick once we figured out why I got sent a used one an paid for a new one. The second one they sent was new in the box. I love my transformer. I also ordered a keyboard and I love how most aps are free unlike the ipad.	
36	1	2	3	3	3	4	4	1	4	3	3	3	Fast, sleek, two flaws. The ASUS Transformer Prime is a great tablet. It's super fast and very easy to use. The construction of the tablet is top-notch. It's a nice weight and the screen is incredibly clear.Now for the two flaws... The plug port is on the bottom (the opposite side of the camera). That means if you use a case/cover like the rooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle, you can't charge the tablet while using the case stand. The tablet has to be laying flat instead of angled while charging. Moving the charge port to one of the short sides (from the long side) would fix this issue.The second flaw is the cable. Mine completely came apart at the USB end where it plugs into the wall charger. I had to use black electrical tape to hold it together, and now the tablet doesn't indicate it's charging when plugged in. Luckily, it does still charge, but the cable isn't communicating that to the tablet. Based on other reviews, this seems to be a common problem.Overall, I'd recommend this tablet and it would get 5 stars by moving the charger port and constructing a better cable.	
37	4	0	4	0	4	3	1	1	4	2	4	4	No GPS. The GPS is almost absolutely worthless.  I should have read reviews more carefully.  If I knew it ahead of time, I would not have purchased it.  I have a Motorola X00M AND THE gps WORKS PERFECTLY.	
38	2	4	3	4	2	4	0	0	2	4	4	4	Great tablet. The hardware is nice, but it's Asus' commitment to delivering updates quickly that really makes this option shine. You'd just be hard pressed to find more bang for your buck than the Asus line. This is my second, and they're going to kids for Christmas to justify my upgrade to the Asus Transformer Prime!Load up Google Voice, GrooVe IP and Famigo Sandbox (depending on the age), and you'll have kids who won't miss having a phone for years.	
39	4	4	4	3	2	2	4	4	4	4	3	4	Great Tablet! Pros:-Bright Screen with Super IPS.-Faster than any tablet that I've used! Response time from scrolling is very quick even with the animations.-Tegra games look very nice and works with my controller.-Long battery life, not a disappointment.-The custom interface graphics are well done. Love the dolphin live wallpaper!-Camera, 8mp back and front camera is good enough for face time.-Was able to playback 1080p videos pretty smoothly. Never have to convert a movie again!-Supernotes - seems handy for school. Hand write, draw, type.Cons:-had wifi connection timeouts while my other prime tablet doesn't.-Random clicks (sometimes happen, but locking it again will fix it).Overall, this tablet is great buy for $499! There's not a lot of bloatware, so I don't need to deal with that. I've played games on it for about 8 hours on balanced mode and the battery still shows 20-25%. I'm still waiting for my keyboard however. I would recommend this tablet to anyone.	
40	4	2	3	4	3	2	0	0	4	4	2	1	Asus Transformer Prime - IPAD killr ? Hi guys,Figured I'd stop by since this is the hot toy for the Christmas season !I purchased the 32GB champagne color. I havent put T201 thru its paces yet butdid perform some testing.Quality =Fit and finish is 100%, Very solid feel.Size =Very thin, kinda difficult to hold in hand, I'd recommend purchasing a gel caseor something similar.Gaming =Played the pre-install games and they both ran with 0 stutters and wereextremely fluid. did i purchase a a multipurpose tablet or a gaming tablet... i think the latter :)Performance =Tablet was completely fluid when changing from one screen to the next, i especially like the multi windowtab on the bottom left, it will allow you to select anything previously opened (and will allow you to close too)Built in music player seemed basic and didnt appear to have the ability to download album art. I'll stick withamazon cloud mp3 player.Web =(subjet to further testing) web browsing seemed to be alittle slow, this was experienced with java enabled... with disabled performance was snappy and goodYouTube & amazon streaming =using the youtube app , it was a beautiful display and worked flawlessly. Amazon needs to make an app to stream their prime videos instead of going thru the web... however once a few buttons are pressed the video does fill the entire screen and works. Please note imbedded youtube in web DID NOT display any stutter or frame drops.Sound =Unfortunately this is what caused me to give 4 instead of 5 stars. The audio is quite loud and clearhowever only being emitted from a single speaker port does not provide the spartial/stereo sound. perhapsblue tooth or headset will eliminate this concern.Camera =Front facing 1.2MP camera provided acceptable image quality, however white balance should be adjusted to fully ensure quality (dont use automatic) , rear facing camera provided a good quality picture with decent focus and brightness... even in poor lighting conditions however any zoom used the image would be blurry depending upon x2 x3 etc. video mode was tested with low movement and provided a better quality then my nikon p500 (p500 seems to be abit jumpy).Battery life =Unable to report at this time since testing was limited to less then a full charge.Display =Was very colorful and bright, 600 nits of brightness will make it useable outside. normal amount of backlight bleeding (almost none but there's always some). backlight bleed test was performed and two hot spots were identified one on bottom and other on right side. As mentioned previously the amount of light imo is quite minimal and i've seen far worse on other items. one of my apps displayed a completely white page and there was two hot spots (white slightly brigter then the rest of the page) this may be a fluke or not... i was able to duplicate the brighter pixel, its barely noticeable however is visable on default screen in other colors... not a deal breaker its about the size of a pin head with a slight glow around it, clarification you wouldnt know its there unless i told you to look for it.WIFI Range =two apps were used to test the wifi range speedtest (same test server) and wifi analyzer. I've only compared the two and not a laptop.. plus my house has about 800watts of electronic interference :)12 feet away from base stationevo3d = 15.38 down 4.86 up signal str = -46 dbmprime = 20.50 down 5.00 up signal str = -43 dbmtwo walls, outside, about 85 feet awayevo3d = 02.26 down 0.89 up signal str = -88 dbmprime = 05.50 down 3.00 up signal str = -75 dbmGPS =Best reception i got was 5/9 stable 4/8.UPDATE: Reports have been surfacing GPS isnt working or isnt working properly... When I performed the test it did find 4/8 and continued to have the searching graphic. Honestly I dont know what is normal for GPS reception with this device. Will compare against phone later.Operation & bugs =With any new device there will be patches and bug fixes, I dont assume any different with the prime.while transferring pictures via usb , i was viewing the pictures and multiple times it froze and displayederror resulting in restart of picture viewer. Another item was installation of a large gamesoft game dungeonrunners 2, I had music playing in the background and every 15 seconds or so the music would stutter for a second or twoand then continue playing. I'm sure this will be addressed with ICE and the use of 4/5 cores properly.I'll update this review as time allowsIf you guys want specific info or test , please feel free to ask !01/09/12GPS has issues... perhaps big onces since Asus removed GPS from spec sheet. it appears the metal backing is a hinderance for the gps signal.Latest asus update has improved web speed w/java enabled. I prevously tested wireless and it provided a good speed outside the house. but a few rooms across in my house and the speed dropped extremely low, after update its doubled @ same location.01/19/12reduced another point due to asus removing GPS from their sales web site, Additionally Asus should offer a replacement backplate to elminate the gps and wifi issues. Please note ICS has made the web browsing experience lightning fast - im very impressed. I'm seriously concerned about the future of the prime , the handling of the signal issues , and amazon removing it from sale. I'm returning this to amazon till the smoke clears.	
41	0	0	0	4	1	4	4	2	4	4	0	0	to much for a tab...i could buy a netbook and have more capabilities. so i dont actually own one but c'mon 600 for a tab!!! i can buy a netbook with a 320 gb harddrive more i/o capabilities and the such, this tab has no good i/o and for 100 or so more i can add a keyboard which in turn makes it similar to a netbook!!! pay more for less basically	
42	2	4	4	1	4	1	1	4	4	3	3	4	nice if unlockable device. OLD: (This device is trapped under encrypted bootloader. So you are not free to do anything that you want to do with what you are paying for. Very good hardware. But once again: locked hardware. So asus is renting not selling this device. If you want a 1% of this tablet device: no doubt and buy it.)UPDATE (After ASUS told that will be a tool to unlock the device):Nice hardware and probably the king of tablets by now.	
43	3	0	2	4	2	1	2	4	4	0	2	4	BOOTLOADER LOCKED (Fixed and Updated) Asus has made a great product, but then locked the bootloader.  Consider this carefully in your purchase decision.  Search for:  Asus Locked BootloaderUpdate:  Asus announced that it will offer a bootloader unlocking tool in the near future.  Also upcoming will be an OS Android update to 4.0 (ICS).  This is a good move on Asus's part that will please a large customer base.  Because of the potential ability to unlock the bootloader, I've increased my rating from one to three stars.  However, it remains to be seen how Asus will approach this option.  It should be noted that the "Prime" still has reported GPS problems, and material/product defects that some users have experienced.Pros:Possible future tool for unlocking the bootloaderUpdate to Android OS 4.0 (ICS)Lightweight thin designGreat, crisp, clear, scratch resistant IPS viewing screenCons:Slick, smooth back design that may be difficult to hold on to (compared to the Toshiba Thrive)No USB port (you must purchase either the optional keyboard dock or USB adapter)Proprietary AC/DC "port" on front edge side of case that seems awkward and may be subject to accidental breakageReported GPS problems because of the metal case designReported defects in the fit and finish of the product	
44	2	3	2	2	4	4	3	2	1	0	3	3	Impressive tablet. I'd give it a 5, except for the short WiFi range. It gets a good signal when close but drops off quickly if more than 15-20 feet away from source.Solid design, incredible performance.	
45	2	0	0	4	1	2	4	0	4	0	0	0	Random reboot issue so I returned mine. I read the negative reviews regarding WiFi and GPS issues and decided to go ahead with the purchase despite the problems because it looked like Asus was addressing them.  However, their way of addressing those issues was to redesign the product as the TF700 with a plastic back (which the TF201 should have had), add a few bells and whistles, and charge $100 more. Why they didn't just bite the bullet and retrofit the TF201 with a plastic back and satisfy all those customers who already plunked down $500 is beyond me.  In any event, I got the unit yesterday and there was an immediate update to Android 4.0 right when I booted it up.  I thought, "great I'll have the newest version right out of the box".  The only problem is that doing the update results in a tablet that randomly locks and reboots.  I had it less than 24 hours and it randomly locked and rebooted at least 15 times.  After reading the message boards (not the Asus support site, which has no reference to any of the problems), I realized that I was not alone in the rebooting issue.  I've put up with enough marginally functional computer products in my lifetime but I've finally realized that if I pay $500 for a product, it should work properly right out of the box.  So, I boxed it up and returned it and will monitor tablet reviews religiously before I commit to another one, especially one from Asus.	
46	2	0	4	0	2	4	4	3	2	1	1	3	Why is Amazon's price $100 more. This review is not on the quality itself, instead it is the fact that Amazon's is almost $100 more than other websites' that really bugs me.  I read many good reviews but decided to wait til March, when Asus release the fixes of all the current complaints of the GPS & WiFi performances.	
47	3	1	3	2	2	2	0	0	0	3	4	4	After a couple of hours... I must say, I am very excited about this tablet.  It is my first, and I pre-ordered in December, so I received it about a week ahead of schedule, very nice start!When I booted for the first time, Ice Cream Sandwich was ready for install, took about 10 minutes (this thing IS powerful).  Fit and finish are very very nice.  The speed is incredible.If you want the absolute state of the art, this is your tablet.

First the battery life sucks - And it takes forever to charge.  Second, while reading, the Fire jumps and skips pages and chapters, then I have to find my way back to where I was reading.  It may jump 1,2,or 3 pages but mostly jumps chapters.  Very annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Because of this, I am now in the market for a new tablet.  My concern is that with the new tablet, I won't be able to access my kindle library.  Is this a fact or is there an app out there that allows me to get a kindle ebook on another tablet??	
49	3	3	0	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	my TF201 unboxing experience. Amazon delivered my TF201 yesterday evening.  My 15 year old son was super excited and unpacked the device (we have a tablet?!_ Is it Tegra3?!).  I entered my Android account info and went to the home office to take a conf call.When I returned an hour later he was busy customizing the device.  I did a quick check of the OS (Android 4.0.3) and checked WiFi perf (5Mb/s) and let the kids loose with it.For the next 3 hours my boys (15, 14 and 9 years old) were fighting over who got to play with it next.  Graphics and touch responsiveness are awesome.  Visual computing taken to a new level.Asus seems to have wrung out the early kinks and the Ice Cream Sandwich promise is real.	
50	1	1	3	3	0	3	0	1	2	4	4	4	Two Words: Buttery Smooth. The screen is phenomenal with zero bleed.Every action is zippy and buttery smooth.The keyboard has superb key response - better than any netbook I've owned.The wifi is weak.  Couldn't connect to the mediocre to weak signal at my workplace.  Oh well.  I have a laptop for that anyway.  I had no problems with wifi at home.GPS does not work, as advertized.  Could not connect at all.I'm still posting a five star review.  Why?  Because there are a lot of false negative reviews on here, and counterbalancing those is the same effect as a statistician adjusting for variables.The build quality is superb and the integration with the keyboard dock is seamless physically and intuitively.Also, seriously, this is TEGRA 3 living up to its hype.With ICE CREAM SANDWICH, also living up to its hype.That is worth the price of admission.  Two months' wait stunk, but as an early adopter, I've paid that price before.  And now I have it.	
51	4	4	3	3	0	4	2	4	0	4	1	0	Reviewing This Again 8 Months Later. Initially, I really loved this tablet. It was fast and ran everything as smooth as silk. After a while, things began going downhill gradually, and the love affair basically ended. The wifi speed was always slow, but it eventually began to gnaw at me how terrible this thing was when I really needed it. Updates from Asus became few and far between and after releasing the new version of this tablet just a short couple of months later they abandoned this and everyone who had initially defended this device in the beginning. I was able to salvage a bit of usability by installing a custom ROM, but just recently the camera has stopped working, which is apparently just par for the course for the Transformer Prime. What could have been an amazing piece of technology seems more like an attempt to grab as much cash as possible on something they knew to be faulty and cut their losses in the end. I still love Android, but I can safely say I wouldn't buy another Asus product in the future to save my life. Stick with Samsung or some of the other manufacturers who know how to make hardware.	
52	4	4	2	3	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	Best Tablet Ever! I have changed my tune since receiving my TF201 back from being RMA'd.  The NVIDIA graphics on this thing are off the charts, and it has the processing power to handle it.  Dear iPad2, you've been hit so hard that the iPad3 is gonna feel it...cuz the Transformer Prime is laying the smackdown!  Seriously, I am considering selling my laptop and going full out Transformer Prime!	
53	3	2	4	4	4	2	4	4	2	4	4	4	The best tablet available at this time. Period! Pre-ordered this late last year while owning the original Transformer with dock. Have now had this long enough to go through all of the paces including the dock (of which I went through 3 to find a perfect one).Originally I was going to purchase an iPad2 like so many others that cannot get past the Starbucks fascination of owning an Apple product. My primary concern with Apple products including my iPhone was the lack of real memory with Apple limiting any expansion in their products-though great otherwise. As I recently converted both of my phones over to Android phones, that pretty much clinched the purchase as purchasing and juggling two platforms made little sense. I did go at it slow originally as I wanted to ensure that the tools (apps) I require were both available and worked well on the Android system vs Apple. Now only were they available, even better options were to be found which was a pleasant surprise as a lot of junk apps are also on the Android Market.Now to the tablet:Breaking this down into simple terms:Pros:.Very fast. With quad core and an extra chip to handle video, this tablet is speed with ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich). With exception to browsing (Dolphin HD) which is just OK. Try out Opera..Battery life:  An honest 9 hrs+ with just tablet and over 17 hrs with the dock. Even while watching movies the battery drains very slowly. Very impressive. Also, the dock charges the tablet when connected..Styling. Extremely nice and modern style. All aluminum (which is also it's greatest sin). This tablet is hot looking. I have tghe champagne version which is more like a light metallic bronze..Expandability: Micro HDMI, USB (dock), miniSD. I have a 128gb microSD card for a total of 192gb in the tablet alone and a 64gb in the dock for a total of 256gb. I have a large amount of HD movies, games, photos, apps, etc. All play very well from the cards with no hiccups of any sort. Native USB mouse support and native PS3 controller support via USB. Just plug and go, no ROM needed. Also, the mentioned dock is an exceptional accessory. It adds battery life, USB, looks great, fits well , and really does complete the package..Video playback. Another win over iPhone is the ability to play a wide array of movie formats which Apple can be stubborn about. Playback is very smooth, bright, and you can easily scroll forward or back with no delay or crashes. Very impressive..Graphics:  Superb, the best available on a tablet at the moment. Just youtube comparisons of Shadowgun and Riptide vs. the iPad2 and you will see the dramatic improvements over the iPad and original Transformer..WIFI:  LOL.  Many complain about the WIFI as the aluminum backing does inhibit the signal. However my particular model has great WIFI and downloads faster than any tablet prior. No issues at all here. Additionally, I Hotspot off of my 4G Android phones, again no issues. No fee either through my carrier..Screen: Large 10.1" screen with Gorilla Glass and highest tablet resolution at the moment. Very strong, very bright IPS, even outdoors. Movies and games look great along with spreadsheets.CONS.Lack of accessories such as cases with the tablet/dock (current versions are designed incorrectly resulting in too thick of material between dock and tablet hinge.) Ton of stuff available for iPads and the original Transformer (those will not fit the Prime).GPS. Yep, I do not use it on a tablet, but it is advertised (before), and the signal is blocked by that gorgeous aluminum backing. Simply does not work on mine. EDIT: Recent firmwares have improved this and it does now lock onto over 12 satellites though still not great for driving.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recent airplane trip. Edited a few spreadsheets, tired of that, decided to watch a full length HD movie, then connect my PS3 controller and played Shadowgun. The guy sitting next to me and another across from the aisle were blown away with this tablet sparking plenty of conversation. It is an impressive piece which has a tendency to draw people into your business. Expect it unless your doing something boring. Using it in the AM, then at the terminal, on the flight, I still had over 80% of total battery left. I did not even bother taking out my laptop.Overall with dock and memory cards (2) it was a bit expensive, however at the end of the day, well worth it IMO..	
54	3	2	4	0	4	4	4	3	4	2	3	4	With exception of wi-fi reception, a excellent tablet. Amazenly fast and responsive, with all the connection options any user could hope for. Preloaded software is actually useful, something I usually uninstall or hide from the beginning. If you can wait and pay another $100, I would consider the updated model probably coming later this spring. This is because even as I range from my wifi souce in my apartment, and add some walls between the tablet and the source, the signal drops much quicker than other devices with wifi available (Droid Incredible for example). If you have a small house or apartment or shack, no problem, but beware the long distances!Other than that, could not be happier. And don't believe the gusy who say that file management is difficult. I can easily treat my like an external hard drive.	
55	2	4	4	0	4	2	0	3	2	4	4	4	Asus Prime. Excellant Tablet. No Wifi issues here . (I can walk 300 feet down my driveway and still be connected). GPS . I have to go outside for GPS to work 100 percent ( same as my 3 Garmins and Ham radio Handy-talkie)If you take it out of "balanced mode" and enable it to use the graphics GPU's this sucker IS fast.(most salespeople I have encountered have NO idea of these settings and NO idea of the NVIDEA  games available. (Theyre too busy selling overhyped and over priced Ipads)The ability to spend 6 bucks on an HDMI cable and play it on my HD tv is fantastic!The ability to move a memory card back and forth between my HDMI Contour camera,my cell phone,mylaptop and my PC is nice.	
56	4	2	4	1	2	2	4	0	4	0	3	4	ASUS Transformer Prime. I ordered this tablet dispite some nasty reviews about faulty equipment. However, all reviews indicated that ASUS was taking care of the faulty units. I was overjoyed to find out that my unit was not one of the faulty ones. I have wifi all over my house and I can use the GPS just fine. The processing power of the Prime is incredible. I had tried a floor model in Best Buy and saw some frame studdering, but I have yet to have a single studder in my unit. All the screens and transitions are incredibly fluid. The outdoor read ability is much better than I thought it would be. It of course is not like having e-ink, but it is still very good. The new battery keeps me going all day long. I've used the camera and video to capture my son with his sports. The video is the best I've seen on a mobile device. My wife has a phone that claims 1080p video, but it is choppy. The Prime can take 1080p video and never miss a frame. I would definetely recommend this product to any android fanboys.	
57	3	2	0	0	4	2	4	4	4	0	1	4	A little disappointed ... so far. Finally saw Amazon has 15 in stock and I immediately ordered one.  I have been using it extensively for the last 3 days.  All reviews praised about how fast this is.  But I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed.  Once in a while, the browser would hesitate and even pop up asking me whether I want to kill it or wait.The 2-finger pinch/zoom is too sensitive and it often over zooms it.  My HTC android phone has a better browser pinch/zoom than this.  Also, the browser on my HTC seems to have better auto-size capability than the browser on the Prime.I am a bit baffled as why some common 2-finger gestures do not work in the browser.  e.g. 2-finger swipe left/right to back/forward web pages, which are quite common on Acer or Asus laptops' touchpads.The keyboard dock is solid, well-built, and it integrates well with tablet.  Keys are fine but I find myself missing the right "Shift" key often.  So far, the only 2-finger gesture is just scrolling web pages on touchpad.  Again, my Acer and Asus laptops' touchpads could do a lot more by default.Overall, it's an excellent product.  I just feel I was disappointed on a few areas.  Perhaps, due to my own unfamiliarity with the product at this point.  Will provide updates later if I feel any different.==============UPDATE================================================Today, I suddenly noticed the face panel of tablet is slightly warped on the left edge (where the volume control is).  When running my finger across the panel, I could feel the "curvature".  If looking closely, I could see a gap between the face panel and the casing.  The length of the gap is about 1.5 inches.  I am taking another star off the rating.  Good thing is that I could still return this tablet with such defect back to Amazon for a full refund.The reason I am returning instead of getting a replacement is that, as much as I want a tablet, I find myself tired of holding the tablet when using it.  I want to put it into its keyboard dock most of the time.  However, the keyboard is just too small for extensive typing and the touch pad on the dock isn't really that good.  Therefore, I ended up wanting to use my Acer S3 Ultrabook instead because of its larger screen and excellent touch pad.So, I have been asking myself a hard question this week: Do I really need a $650 tablet & dock if I use it like a netbook most of the time???The finding of the warped face panel finally made me face the reality: I do NOT need a tablet because of my usage pattern.  A thin, light-weight, and instant-on Ultrabook can best meet my needs.	
58	0	2	4	2	0	3	4	4	4	0	0	0	Was unable to set up. Not sure what the problem was but it didn't connect to my router. After contacting Asus support to troubleshoot I got and Android guy on his side. So was advised to return the tablet. I still haven't gotten a refund. Disappointed as I read mant great reviews.	
59	2	3	3	0	3	1	2	2	4	4	2	4	problems with the ICS. Neat look, great design but i had to give it back because when I updated to the ICS it starting to glitch all the time. I couldn't work continuosly for more than 5 minutes. It a shame because its a great tablet.	
60	2	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	2	4	Almost Delivers on It's Promises. Asus markets the Transformer Prime as the ultimate Android tablet...and it almost is.  My experience mirrors precisely that of many of the reviewers here:Pros:  Sleek size; beautiful design; blazingly fast processor; Android ICS; optional keyboardCons:  Wi-Fi reception is marginal at best, pitiful beyond a certain distance from the wireless router.  My laptop (also an Asus) gets good reception on my 2nd story deck (router is downstairs), while my Transformer cannot hold onto the signal; speaker is often not loud enough for some video/audio stuff, while some sites are OK (YouTube); 2 dead pixels on display; no GPS signal, even outside.  I haven't yet ordered the free GPS dongle from Asus.Overall, I am fairly pleased with my purchase, though I wanted to be "wowed".  I was hoping the complaints were overblown, but they are not.  This could have been the iPad equal, but not quite.  I still prefer Android, so I'll stick with it.  Hopefully Asus will get it right with the next generation.	
61	4	4	4	4	3	2	4	1	4	0	1	4	speed? for being 1.66ghz quad-core, i'm severely disappointed. my galaxy nexus phone is by far faster on any comparison i can think to make. my galaxy tab from last year (running honeycomb) is at least as fast, and probably faster as well.this just enforces the point that there's a lot more to the speed of a computer than the processor.	
62	4	1	0	1	3	1	4	0	4	3	1	0	Look elsewhere. Since I got this tablet I have had slow internet that would stop and close quite often for no reason.  It will not display aspx/form pages well at all.  I, like a fool, bought the keyboard and like many others around the world have a cracked glass because of it.  I returned to ASUS and was confronted with a $250 repair bill.  It's a nice toy but not worth the $700 I paid and now $250 to fix.  If you do get this tablet, DO NOT GET THE KEYBOARD.  Plus the added bonus if you buy from Amazon you cannot get an aftermarket warranty.  Just more of the same from ASUS.	
63	4	3	2	4	1	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	Transformer Prime : best  product i bought on amazon. I bought the transformer prime on Amazon US because it was out of stock every where in UK. The seller was very good the parcel was delivered on time and in mint condition. I have the table for almost 5 months now and i never had any issue what so ever. people have complained about the WiFi and GPS but I have never experience such issue , my transformer picks up the signal pretty well , sometime even better than my Nexus S.This little thing has saved my life several time, it possibility to act as net book(Very portable and fast net book) make this tablet an life changer and although people argue that it pricey, i would say that it worth spending some cash on it . It is solid, the screen is scratch resistant thanks to it gorilla glass and the metallic body make it look very posh and yet durable. Also, ASUS is very good at assisting their customer so far they have been pushing updates very often and fast and I believe it will be even better now that they have sign partnership with Google.The prime is a powerful entertainment gadget, sometime it beats my PS3 as it plays 1080p MKV file very smoothly. Hook it up to the receiver for the best High Def experience. However I have noticed that the sound output while using the HDMI cable is some how mono or only stereo. I hope ASUS or Google find the way around it.The prime came with loads of cool app. My favourite one is MyCloud, which let you control your home pc from where ever you are as if your table was running Windows. All touch gesture are supported (unlike other like Teamviewer)the experience is amazing . one day I went to a party and they didn't have music, thanks to the Prime and the Mycloud app, I was actually playing the music from my home PC but the sound was output on the Prime miles away from home.This is just a little overview of what the Prime has bought to my life... Really ... I am in looove with it	
64	4	4	2	1	2	2	0	4	4	0	4	4	Simply Amazing! ** typing this review from my Transformer Prime.**I work in IT and I have used just about every device on the market. I can easily say that this is the tablet to beat. Its fast! easy to use for those who aren't as tech savvy but also provides the most functionality for those of you who are. You may surprise yourself with how easy it is to learn and adapt. All of the reviews on here speaking of people complaining about the wifi... its the same wifi you would find on a mobile phone. You can't expect to get the same range as a high powered laptop. That being said,other than some minor Android OS hickups which are expected and the reason Google creates updates, it works great! I especially like the ability to setup a home share network with my windows 7 PC's to stream music both to and from my tablet. Kudos to Google, Asus, and Nvidia. I brought this thing to work and other coworkers couldn't get enough and actually purchased it as well. ASUS especially rocks for the myNet app and this tab!	
65	1	4	2	4	3	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	ASUS Transformer Prime Questionable. It's been few weeks using this machine and not satisfied with it. First, screen rotation does not work well as indicated. Second, touch-screen is not sensitive enough picking up a typical touching motion, which worked fine in Ipad 2 or Samsung's. Third, Amazon would charge a return fee when I was trying to return this unsatisfactory and incomplete product. No positives, Only negatives from both the product and Amazon.	
66	3	2	1	0	4	2	4	0	4	2	3	2	One of the Better Novelty Tablets. I'm not slamming this tablet.  I'm just pointing out some flaws of most tablets for those that may not know what they're getting themselves into.It's one of the better tablets out there but tablets are still a novelty item.  They have their uses but they definitely aren't notebook replacements and have a place where you don't want to wield a notebook.  Overall it's a good addition to my device collection but my Dell Inspiron Duo provides a better "real web" experience because it has a real desktop OS.  The color doesn't look gray to me but what a champagne would look like.  I've never seen a champagne in person and I've verified the model numbers in store as well and they say gray.I've used the Android OS since the HTC G1 came out and have every major version up through 4.x.  Once mobile Flash was finally introduced, pocket web browsing became a much better experience.  The worst thing about stock Android is they never fixed their e-mail client (no, I don't use their gmail and use an ISP) and it still has the same basic problems since the beginning.  They obviously don't care since they want you to use gmail.The apple crowd have it worse with the lack of flash support but everyone hates being redirected to a mobile site when they've paid good money on a capable machine.  Changing the UserAgent usually doesn't work much these days.  Some sites provide you the option to go to the full site but many don't.  And some sites want you to download a stupid application for a web site.  Hmmm, I just want one web browser for every web site I visit, not an application for every web site I would visit.  I don't need the appcrap kind sir.  The googletv falls into this category as well.I also don't enjoying going to YouTube and getting a notification that the video is not allowed to play on my mobile device.  It's bad enough we get notifications that the video isn't allowed in your country.  Some streaming web sites will also give you the 'no mobile devices allowed'.And the applications.  Everything I ever downloaded for the Android platform has been free and I like it that way.  Maybe I deserve what I get for not paying for the full version but I'm sure that's not the case.  One size does not fit all...installer beware.  Because of the splintering between manufacturers and wireless carries (talking versions) on all these mobile devices, not everything works the way it should or even at all.  The same goes for OS updates.  If you're on a telephone then you're pretty much at the mercy of your wireless provider and what they determine the shelf life of your 3-6 month product.  Good luck getting updates up through your 2 year plan.  Tablets are another story if they're WiFi only models.  Good luck with the vendor.  At least Asus has been okay thus far but I'm sure we've seen the better days of updates.  What if Microsoft didn't provide you Windows Updates after owning your shiny new Packard Bell for 9 months?Oh how I hate virtual keyboards for anything more than inputting passwords....Complex passwords?  Fugetaboutit!!  I picked up the keyboard for this and it's a lifesaver for typing.  I'd like to see Microsoft Surface users enjoying their spreadsheets with a touchscreen.  I'm looking forward to the Surface platform because if it solves the issues I state above, so long Android.Life's Connected Rules:You shouldn't tote around any mobile telephone with a screen size larger than 4".

67	2	0	1	2	2	4	3	2	4	4	0	0	Worst tablet and customer service I've ever experienced. I don't normally write reviews. Most products are not good or bad enough for me to care. This is honestly the worst experience I have ever had with a product. My need for a laptop replacement for college is the only reason it wasn't immediately returned.The short version: don't buy it. The customer service is worthless and the quality control is nonexistent. Go buy a Nexus 10 or something else from Samsung.PROS: None. There isn't a single good thing I can say about this tablet that matters at all to me. The closest I can come is that it's a nice looking paperweight. But honestly, looks are only a pro if it works. Otherwise, who cares?CONS: This one needs categories  BEFORE REPAIR TABLET: The tablet itself was glitchy from day one.  GPS: Like everyone else has said, they suck. The GPS, I can deal with. I wasn't really planning on using it much for that purpose. That said, if you advertise a feature, that feature had better work. If I buy a tablet that advertises GPS, I want to be able to use it whether that's its main purpose or not. The GPS dongle that was ASUS's fix is ugly and prevents the use of the dock, which was a big selling point for the tablet. Before repair, the dongle failed to improve the GPS. It still could never get a lock.  WIFI: Again, it's as bad as everyone has said. I had read that some people had decent signal strength. Mine did not.  GRAPHICS: This was one of the biggest problems. It never could render the graphics properly. Anything displayed on the screen was distorted and shaded oddly. Instead of smooth shading, there were only a few very noticeable breaks where the shading changed. Everything had distorted edges. If I were to guess, I would say the graphics processor was damaged or was not properly attached. This was the one of the reasons I originally sent it in for repair.  FREEZING: This was the other big problem. This thing has a quad-core processor. It had more processing power than the broken laptop it was replacing. It had more than enough power to run everything perfectly smoothly as advertised. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. It constantly froze on the simplest tasks. Browsing the internet wasn't possible through either the stock browser or any Play Store replacements. The tablet would always stop responding.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: ASUS has the worst customer service period. Honestly, I would get better results from beating my head on a rusty nail. I can't adequately describe how amazingly awful it is. When I first contacted them, they were quick to issue an RMA. That was the only thing they did quickly. The repair center had the tablet for 6 weeks. I had no contact from ASUS about what was going on. Their repair status website had some cryptic code that meant nothing to anyone who didn't work at ASUS. I had no idea what was going on. I honestly think they just dumped it in a corner somewhere and forgot about it. Things finally started moving when I filed a complaint with ASUS. However, they still did not tell me what was going on. They intentionally waited almost 2 more weeks to respond to my complaint after the delivery confirmation informed them I had picked up the tablet. This response actually took me longer than necessary to decipher since they couldn't be bothered to glance over the couple of sentences they wrote. This pathetic example of how NOT to conduct business would have concluded here if the tablet were actually fixed. It was not.  AFTER REPAIR TABLET:  GPS: Without the dongle, the GPS was unimproved, but it works with the dongle now.  WIFI: Wifi is about the same. It will never have perfect signal strength because of the design flaws.  GRAPHICS: The constant bad shading and edges were mostly fixed. I say mostly because while it isn't constantly messed up as before, the graphics still freak out periodically.  FREEZING: The freezing is much, much worse, and it continues to get worse.  TOUCH: This is a new problem since the repair. Many times when I touch the screen, it will react as if I touched a completely different area. It won't always recognize swiping to scroll a page. This is also getting worse.  MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE: Since the repair actually made the tablet worse, I unfortunately was not done dealing with ASUS. Instead of offering a replacement or an advanced RMA, they continued to insist that I send them the tablet again. Surprisingly, I don't trust them any more. After waiting 6 weeks to receive a tablet with more problems than it was sent with, I just don't think this particular tablet is reparable. Since they refused to help, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I won't give any details from that other than the complaint is still open after 5.5 weeks.If you've made it this far, I should add one more thing. ASUS knew about every one of these problems before they released this model. It was replaced in less than a year by a fixed version, the TF700t, aka the Transformer Pad Infinity. The only difference in specs is a slightly higher resolution screen. The tablets are sold for the same price. Actually, I just checked. Amazon sells the 64 GB version of the TF700t for less than the 64 GB version of the TF201.	
68	4	0	2	3	0	4	4	4	4	0	2	0	Great Tablet but failed in only 10 months. As with a lot of electronics these days, you will find that they have "common" problems that will plague any tablet.  In our case, the tablet's display just went blank at 10 months old.  a quick google search of this problem and you found hundreds of forums that spoke about this exact problem. You can hold down the POwer Button for a "reboot" and you can hear it beep, but no screen!  Have to send it in for a whole new motherboard, or so they tell me.  just sending this tablet out this week to their Company Service Center.

71	4	4	4	1	4	2	2	4	0	4	3	4	Transformer Prime Tablet. This tablet is a high quality tablet...but there are a couple of issues of concern for m e...while writing the tablet seems to have a mind of its own...the cursor occaissionally backtracks or moves itself to another place on the page without being commanded to do so. The factory browser also does not give the user the option of adding a file menu or other menu in the tool bar area.	
72	0	4	4	4	4	0	0	3	4	1	2	4	Very nice tablet with some flaws ... Well, I was really excited about this tablet when I found it online. All the reviews looked good and so I decided to buy me one.Here is from my point of view the good and the bad:Pros:- very nice touch screen with good contrast and brightness- intuitive user interface- good touchscreen response- excellent mechanical built and nice design- nice set of apps factory installed [browser, email, gallery =, etc.]- micro SD card memory extension, which is completely accessible via USB- nice video playback- easy WiFi setupCons:- mediocre WiFi sensitivity compared at same location [e.g. poor on the tablet vs. good on my laptop]- multiple dead pixels in the display- the current OS only supports 4bit per pixel images which leads to heavy banding in photographs- comes with only 2GB SD memory installedIt's a nice tablet for the money but there are some improvements needed. Hopefully they provide an upgrade to the OS soon. I guess the dead pixels on the display come with the rather low price point. Something's gotta give.Hope this helps to make your buying decision. Not sure if I'm going to keep it because I want use it mostly for my photography portfolio and there the dead pixels and the 4bit make things a bit ugly.	
73	3	4	4	0	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	good tablet for the price! I recieved the le pan tablet a few days ago and have been on it nonstop! I am actually writing this review on the tablet now. It is great for online banking, shopping, games and pretty much anything you can think of. As others have said this product worked great right out of the box. I didnt even have to charge it for a few hours. I am a student, so i have taken this tablet to school. Every wifi i have connected it with so far has given me zero problems. The only problems i have had, or not even really large issues at all  are that the tanlet only comes with one wall charger, the fingerprints are definitely annoying(although i am going to order the screen protector today for this tablet, if you do not like an excessive amount of fingerprints then ordering the screen protector is a must for you, ive also read very good reviews about the screen protector specifically made for this tablet), and the tanlet does not have a usb port. Although this is not a bigissue at all, because i learned that my ipod usb cord works perfectly with this tablet. I wanted to order the leather case with the keyboard that amazon recommends buying for this tablet, but i believe the keyboard is only compatible with a usb port. Although it should work with the ipod cord, so i may order that soon as well. Overall, the tablet is a great product and i only paid 168 for it after signing up for an amazon credit card i got 30 dollars off of the sale price. What a steal! You wont be dissappointed if your just looking for a great basic tablet with millions of apps, tools, and so much more.

Hey y'all...My unit wouldn't do a thing EXCEPT display a battery charging for the 5 or 6 hrs i charged it.  I returned it and THEN read from some folks they had to FULLY CHARGE before it would start up, but once it did, it worked thereafter with NO incident.I saw most of the reviews said "worked straight out of the box, so i panicked and returned it, but maybe that 6800 ma battery on some units needs that 8 hr conditioning BEFORE 1 st use (it says to FULLY CHARGE in the manual, but NOT in the Quick Start Guide and i dint see that till AFTER i returned it)Plus some people in the forum said theirs was like that, so don't give up (like i did : )But make no mistake, this (from just the handling of it since it wouldn't turn on for me : ) is an awesome unit, design is P-E-R-F-E-C-T!Hope this is the case and helps someone who thinks their unit is D.O.A....TGG***UPDATE****Got a replacement from W**mart, free shipping, arrived in a day & a half (on a Saturday Fed Ex no less : )  Love this tablet....	
75	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	Great tablet. I love the 10" screen compared to the 7".  I also thought it was very responsive to touch and was faster than I expected.  I charged it fully as reviews had suggested and had no problem getting started after that.  I used an iPad before, but found this pretty easy to understand.  I'd recommend it for everyday activities--the screen is really nice and it operates well.	
76	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	1	2	4	4	4	happy camper. I was really happy with the quality. The shipping was super fast.would buy again.my kids are enjoying the tablet specially with android market.	
77	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	tablet. So far so Great!  This tablet has been very impressive in all ways.  I have already recommended it to family and friends.  The speed, clarity and quality will make you wonder why someone would buy a higher priced $$$ tablet.

Where to start with this is the problem as my wife has been wowed by this early Christmas present; and I have been impressed with it's technical capabilities.On the upside:1) spectacular graphics capability2) fast download and upload speed on our home wi-fi network3) a nice variety of free aps are available at the Android store4) runs NetFlicks even in Canada - it was a painless install that literally took 30 seconds5) responds to touch screen movements as expected6) multiple home pages means you can specialize each one - games, business etc7) comes with gmail installed8) great battery life9) senses amount of light in room and adjusts screen10) can prety well do what an iPad or Blackberry can do11) GREAT value for the priceOn the downside:1) fingerprints on the screen - really what did we expect with a touch screen2) glossy frame and glass screen means lots of reflections3) no owners manual installed or avalable so you need to be a litle bit of a computer geek if you want to customize it - although most activities seem intuitiveWhen I ordered this I also ordered the 32GB microcard as it only comes with 2GB installed.At $169 THIS IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	
79	4	0	0	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	Perfect Tablet. This had to be one of the best gifts I bought this year.  Easy setup, large screen, just perfect.  And it was a gift for my mom.  She loved it.  (she's 70 years old!)  It was everything the description said it would be.  I had bought a different tablet for my nephew, which sucked, and am returning it and buying this one for him as well.	
80	3	4	1	4	1	2	1	3	4	4	4	4	great tablet. I was thinking of getting an load or even the blackberry but this tablet is amazing. Great screen graphics look clear and crisp. I downloaded a keyboard for free that is much better than the ipads split keyboard.  Android marketplace is fantastic so many apps to choose from got angry birds for free even other apps that usually cost money but are free in the Android market. The gallery has a gorgeous layout quality isn't as good at viewing pictures that are saved off Facebook but still good for a tablet.Large screen is great for watching videos YouTube or others. Great for writing has everything the ipad has and more especially for the price great item.  Its my first tablet and I must say fantastic. I do my schooling with this tablet as well as writing notes and entertainment such as watching videos and playing games.  Reading is also fantastic with the Amazon kindle app. Anyways I give the tablet a 9/10 would be a ten if the graphics were better but for the price (when I bought was 207) fantastic would even pay 300.	
81	4	4	0	4	0	4	1	0	4	4	0	0	What a disaster! I was very exited about my Le Pan tablet at first, things were going well. Then I woke up one morning and the screen was dark. I pressed the power button. Nothing. I pressed the reset button, it comes on and boots to the Le Pan logo screen and stays there. I Press the power button, nothing. I press the reset button again and it boots to the Le Pan logo screen and stays there.Wash, rinse, repeat.What now? I'm a week past the point were I can return it to Amazon. I contact Le Pan. They tell me a few things to try. I try them. No joy. Then they give me an RMA. Immediately I became anxious. I don't even know who these people are. What if I never get my tablet back. I keep trying to get it to work. Nothing. Finally I boxed it and sent it out via Fedex, which I had to pay for.Guess what? It's been almost 2 months and I'm still waiting. OMG! How many times do I have to learn this lesson! Never go cheap!Basically, I'm in a black hole without an inkling of when I'm going to see light again. They won't even give me hope! Here's Le Pan's last message to me:"Hello XXXX,Unfortunately we are backed up with RMAs at the moment.Your unit is being processed at this time, though I am unable to give you an estimated day on which we will be able to ship out. We will however, update you with a tracking number when we are shipping the unit back to you. We will move as quickly as possible to get your unit shipped out.Thank you for your patience and we understand that this can be a frustrating process."Hmmm...Apparently I have allot of company in this black hole, even though I can't see them. So yeah it's half the price of the iPad, but half of nothing is nothing. I hope yours never breaks.

I cont'd to use it the following week thinking maybe it was a glitch....well, the whole thing is a glitch! It constantly froze anywhere from 1-4 times w/in just two hours of simply reading a book on it! I wasn't even trying to surf the web or asking it to do anything difficult for Gods' sake! Needless to say, I returned it and got our money back...what a waste of time and money!

84	4	0	0	4	0	0	4	1	0	3	4	4	Get the Le Pan II. I love this thing.  We bought three incredibly functional units, and much prefered he price. My friends' Ipads have nothing on the sleek, solid build and capabilities of the Le Pan Tablet. BUT get the Le Pan 2. This thing is stuck on Froyo.	
85	4	4	4	0	4	0	4	4	4	4	1	3	Nice tablet for the price but you get what you pay for. I got this tablet for my girlfriend's birthday in February 2012. She has an aging laptop that she used for surfing the web so this is a nice, inexpensive replacement that lets her surf the web, play games and read books, at a fraction of the cost of an iPad or other high end tablet. I have been able to compare the Le Pan with an iPad 2 that I borrowed from work. I have used the iPad for a while now, and the Le Pan has several advantages:-Price. Can't say more.-You can load flash websites. It seems with the iPad I have to open up a lot of websites on the computer (online banking, etc never seem to work right)-More free/cheaper apps. By comparison, apps for iPad tend to be more expensive/fewer free apps available (and the free ones are full of ads)-Has built-in GPS (haven't used it much)The Le Pan 970 has some disadvantages:-It does freeze, it seems everyone has a different experience. This one locks up every few hours, especially if using one program (e.g., reading a book or playing a game) continuously. As others have pointed out, I upgraded the firmware right when I got it but the Le Pan still freezes. She keeps a paper clip handy all the time to reset it. Or, you have to remember to close out of the app you are using periodically, although that is not a guarantee.-It is not quite as fast as the iPad. Loading websites, zooming in, etc. takes a second or two longer. Maybe the iPad is faster because it ignores the flash content in many websites.-The camera is backwards. I use Skype with the iPad and it works beautifully, seems with the Le Pan a lot of people report issues.-It runs the somewhat dated version of Android that according to others, was meant for smartphones. So, a lot of websites open up in the mobile version, which can be annoying.All in all, a good tablet if you're on the fence and if you are like me and don't want to spend a lot on a tablet--especially considering that for the price of an iPad you can buy quite nice laptop that lets you do a lot more and get work done. But this is a great tablet to check email/facebook/news while eating breakfast, read a book on a boring day at work or play angry birds. But, only 3 stars because of the fairly frequent (about once daily) freezes.UPDATE August 2012: The freezing got so bad (she had to have a paper clip in hand all the time), she had to send it in to LePan. The customer service is terrible, it took about 6 weeks to get it replaced. 3 Months later, the replaced tablet freezes less often, but still locks up unexpectedly and behaves erratically once/twice a week (apps won't load, websites freeze up) even after rebooting. So, once a month she has to do a factory reset and reinstall everything.	
86	0	4	4	4	0	4	0	4	1	4	3	0	Le Pan 970 review. This product is bang for the buck. Supports flash and responsive. However it hangs sometimes and the screen keeps alot of fingerprints.	
87	0	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	0	1	good at first. i wouldn't suggest this i would hold out for a better one i play on my wife's kindle fire and it runs so much smoother there is no comparison. Yes the screen is smaller but i have had to reset mine a whole bunch and it runs slow sometimes and it also randomly searches or the keyboard screen will come up in the middle of a game and a few other things that doesn't make it the best buy.	
88	4	4	0	3	1	4	4	3	4	2	4	4	Excellentttttt Item!!!!!! so i just recived my lepan 2 in the mial today. ive been playing around with it for the past few hours! i will hoestly say i was kinda iffy on getting the lepan 2 only because i had never heard of the product name before. so i spent about 2 1/2 weeks doing tons and tons of research on the lepan t970 when i stumbled accross the lepan 2. so i then started looking into that one already having liked the first one. i didnt really find as much about the second one. but read that the android market was upgradeable and that i wanted! i spent 295 dollars with shipping on my lepan 2 and let me just say....the price....is UNBEATABLE! i love the expandable storage (which they dont have on the ipad) the adobe flash player!(also not on the ipad) this is such an amazinggg product! while doing research i did notice alot of people saying  that the screen had a pretty bad glare and had very noticible fingerprints so being someone who like my things looking new anyway i purchased a anitglare and anti fingerprint screen! and it works amazinggg. i deff can say my money was well spent. Very High quality! not cheap like at all! and i was worried being such a low price that it may seem cheap....but its not! i love it! and im so glad that i decided to order andother one due to arrive tomorrow for my fiance! who is absolutlyyyy going to loveee it! no questions asked this product is GREATTTTTT! well worht the moneyy!!!	
89	0	1	0	4	0	4	0	4	4	4	0	1	Freezes frequently. since day one screen freezing frequently. in the back there is reset option(small hole in the back), so far i have been poking to restart every time. managed to keep a paper clip with this tablets. showed my 7 year old son how to poke with paper clip when screen freezes. he is willing to keep and use it still. so far havent decided to return, since my 7 yr old son willing to use the poking method in reset hole.i have ipad too, my daughter dropped it few times, screen crakes 100 pieces, placed clear tape. still touch screen works better than le pan tablets.le pan touch screen also slow some times. definitely for kids, wont not recommened. also felt price too high, compare to level of defects.i have seen my friends black berry play book, still much better price wise.update:3/30/2012still son wants to keep it. bought a leather cover, made a hole behind where he poke the reset button many times a day when ever screen freezes(happens 5-10 times every day). what can i do, since he likes it.he also keep a paper clip.	
90	0	4	3	1	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	4	Wonderful and at a great price. This tablet is wonderful! I got it on the 24th of Febuary and waited to use it for a while before posting a review.I love this tablet it does everything I want it to do. I have none of the wifi issues some seem to have. If I have a 3 bar signal or better it is fine for sreaming video on Nexfix or youtube, but the speed is sub par at 2 or less bars of signal.I would like a hdmi cable sooner rather than later, but for it's few problems with cable compatability and updates I think this is a Superb Tablet for $280.It's a budget ipad killer if you ask me.	
91	0	1	4	4	3	0	4	0	4	4	3	4	good tablet for lhalf the price. I purchased this Le pan for my husband for christmas. It worked really well. Not alot of memory but it has room for expansion. It may not be an apple but it is perfect if you like to surf the net and play games. It has great video and it is user freindly. I would purchase the square trade warranty. It is so worth it too! it covers dropping andspilling liquid on it. My husband unfortunatley dropped in on the pavement when his hands were full. My warranty covered it and i am ordering his new replacement today.	
92	3	4	3	0	4	3	2	4	4	4	3	4	Good for the price... but might consider something else if I could change my mind... First, for it's price this is a pretty decent tablet. However, price is not all that matters with these things and it really depends on what you use it for and overall quality.I don't regret the purchase, but people who are used to consumer ready products and don't like to hack, figure things out, etc should stick with Galaxy or iPad.Advantages:- Great price- Solid qualityDisadvantage:- Lack of accessories. Even basic ones such as USB OTG or HDMI connector.- Touchscreen sometimes has trouble with pattern unlock (this may be more my product or my fingers though)- Lacks back camera (I didn't think this would be a problem, but it's something I would like to see). I knew this buying it though and it's negated with the price.General:This is very well built. I'm pleased with the way it feels and it works as I expected (if you have an android phone, it's basically a big giant phone). I had no problems installing Android Applications. Any disadvantages with the software are inherent with the software and not with the tablet.The manufacturer's website is very sparse with information. If you want any significant information you have to search for it and find what others have to say about it.Performance:I use it mostly for PDF reading. It's pretty slow for large files on any number of reading devices. However, it displays small files very well. I use it for double column journal articles and it's big enough (for me) to read it in "fit screen mode." This is true of both Adobe Reader, Aldiko, and one other reader I forgot the name of and have since uninstalled.I installed an unofficial version of VLC player (noneon version) and it works great. No complaints there.Software:It's pretty bare... but that's how I like it. Unlike my Samsung Epic 4G, it's not filled with bloatware and I can install many of them.This is a big plus for me and I've installed all the applications I normally like without any bugs.Applications (known) that I use that work great: Google Voice, Skype, Kindle Reader, Aldiko, Facebook, Firefox, eBay, VLC, Tivo, Wikipedia.The Adobe Reader does strange things when you change stretch/zoom in view settings. For me, if I change it while reading a PDF it escapes out and goes back to the main adobe file selection screen. This may be software though.Networking:It doesn't accept ad hoc connection (unless you root it). I found out this is common to most mobile devices not just Le Pan. The device doesn't seem to have a problem finding my network at home but it does seem to have a hard time finding new networks when I go to Starbucks, Barnes and Nobles, etc (or other restaurant with free Wifi). It's not a huge problem, but it takes a while to find new networks.Bluetooth is slow... It's slower transferring files than my Samsung Epic 4G and a Treo. However, I don't do much with Bluetooth anyway and the mouse I installed works fine and was easy to install.Accessories:Horrible support. This is a relatively new product and it's not from one of the big manufacturers, but it misses some of the basic accessories that they should have made pre-launch. I can say this because I'm an electrical engineer and I've checked their the circuit diagram they submitted to FCC,... there should be no reason they shouldn't have had their HDMI adapter ready at launch.Does not have a 30-pin connector to USB connector. I would have liked to see them come outAlso, regarding accessories, they are difficult to find. You have to send an e-mail to customer support and pay $10 shipping to receive a cable.Their products aren't compatible with any other tablet device. Some iPod chargers work if you shave a piece of plastic off though.Summary:Overall, if you can do without the HDMI or connecting to external USB devices this is an excellent product. The company promises to bring these out, but many new companies break promises. With the Le Pan TC970, they said it would be upgradeable to Honeycomb and now they say it will not be available.	
93	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	0	4	Wonderful, but.... Everything good that has been written about this tablet is true, but ....the firmware implementation of WIFI communications is not robust. With the nice new routers at my house and several friends houses it performs great. The router at work with a T1 and strong signal but older protocol- passable. But several tested Starbucks and McDonalds-- no go after the first time-----Kept trying to get an IP address; fail, and then cycle thru trying over and over. My other two devices and everyone else in the joints had zero problem. Went back home and it was great. Problem-- I need a tablet I can travel with and depend on to get email, directions, reservations, etc. The first order of business for mobile device is connectability to the existing cyberworld and everything needs to follow from that. I love this tablet but it has to go back. No help from manufacturer but expected none. Thank goodness for Amazon. Seriously bummed; there are some very nice things in the implementation of this tablet.	
94	3	4	4	1	0	3	2	3	1	3	3	4	Great tablet but? Originally ordered off Amazon but due to the wait I purchased from Best Buy. Tablet has been great so far have been very impressed; only hardware issue is youtube buffering but that can be fixed by using Dolphin HD browser and setting it to ipad profile, also make sure the Bluetooth is off as they share the same antenna.Now for the "But?" The Lepan site (lepantab.com has been down for 3 days now, you either get redirected to google, unauthorized or page not found,  I would be a little leery about future support, ordering additional unique Lepan power adapters  and  the ICS update is also supposed to be out shortly, hopefully they are only having temporary problems as the tablet has been great. I would give it 5 stars if not for the website issue.Update after some cheecking the website is not down for everyone if your having problems accessing it can be accessed directly by going to [...]

Not sure what to do at this point???  This product is very limited in cases, screen protectors and SERVICE assistance with the packaging that comes from Amazon.  The user manual is electronic - which doesn't help if you can't turn it on.	
96	0	0	4	4	4	3	4	1	3	4	3	1	le pan tc 970. I bought this tablet online and the only issue ive had was about 3 crashes (which were solved by simply pushing the reset button on the back).	
97	4	3	1	4	0	4	1	0	4	0	1	4	Le Pan TC 970 - Does not play YouTube. This product has a really good screen, the size is nice, pictures look good. BUT if you are buying this product to play Youtube then this is not the tablet for you. My daighter (or I) could not get through one YouTube video. I am not sure the reason we tried to clear the cache, use the original YouTube APP and nothing helped. I would not buy this product if you (or your Child) intend on using it for watching YouTube.	
98	1	0	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	1	4	4	Exellent tablet can be as good as iPad 2 but half of the price. I have an iPad 2 too. I would say I am very happy about my Le Pan II. It is almost as good as iPad 2 after I added 32G microSD. Only time having a problem was its restarting hanging ( caused by a downloded waterfall app used for desktop wallpaper) - have to press the reset using a pin - please do not follow some people's suggestion to restore to factory default.  After uninstall the app, the tablet never have a problem to turn on/off.  The Le Pan II can provide everything I need like my iPad2, I don't turn on my laptop often now. Overall, I am very happy about it, can't live without it.	
99	1	0	0	4	0	0	2	4	4	4	3	2	very nice. I was nervous about this purchase due to some of the bad reviews, but decided to give it a try. I've had mine for about 2 months. The price can't be beat. I have had no issues at all (except my Win XP computer won't load drivers, luckily I have a Win 7 that does). I have loaded books, games and apps without a hitch. No problem connecting to the internet via wi-fi (at home and in motels).The included start-up guide is very sketchy, what it doesn't say (and should), before you start using it, plug it in and let it charge overnight. That information is in the guide that is loaded on the tablet and is probably the cause of most of the problems reported in the reviews.PS don't be put off by the "3-4 months to deliver" estimate, the wait was only 3 weeks for me.	
100	0	0	4	3	3	4	4	0	0	4	0	0	Consumers beware!!!!! To all who are thinking of buying this product because of the great price DON'T until you read what I have to say about this tablet. I purchased the Le Pan TC970 for my wife as a Valentines gift. I only read the great reviews of the product and not the 3, 2, or 1 star reviews. I will not make that mistake again.  I made the purchase on Feb. 8th 2012. Right out of the box it had charging problems but after left charging for over 24 hours it worked fine as long as it was always charged. If the battery ran 3/4 of the way down the tablet would just shut off and not turn back on till it was fully charged the next day. I should of sent it back right then and there but I chose to ignore it because it would work fine again. My wife enjoyed using the tablet for the Kindel  books and Pinterest. No games were ever played on it. It was well taken care of. Well fast forward to 6/25/2012 6:44 PM. My wife hands me the tablet and says it is falling apart. I look at it and the screen is popping up and on the bottom edge the seam is coming apart. I first attempted to call the warranty hotline and was told that all operators were busy and to file a claim online. Well I did that at the e-mail that was provided on their warranty page. I sent a picture in with the email and was referred to open a ticket through the website. I did that and was given a response that the sent my case was being sent to their corporate office. Here is all that transpired. This was copied and pasted from their support page. I did not edit it. I even left my spelling errors.Case History (10 Comments)John L. Collins on 6/29/2012 8:48 PMI doubt you truly care. It is sad that based on 1 picture you decided that I destroyed my tablet. That I had to be the one to do it. You didn't even try to help. The only thing you did try was to get me to spend another $150 on the same piece of junk. I would of probably spent the money if you would of at least looked at what would cause it to come apart. If I would of never sent the picture of the tablet then it would be in the mail today with no problems. Instead I tried to do the right thing and trust in your company's warrenty. I would of prefered to have spoken to a operater and discussed this. I made repeated attemps to call with only answering machine to telling to file though here. I should of listened to the reviews of other dissatisfied customers but instead I was being cheap. Lesson learned. I promise that my review of your product will be posted on every place that will let me. I am copying and pasting everything that was emailed back and forth. My review may not stop everyone from buying your products but it will stop some. I am looking into my states lemon laws. I may or may not find anything to help my case but if I do find something you can bet that I will post it everywhere your product is sold. You have a good day.LePan Support on 6/29/2012 9:58 AMJohn,Again, our sincerest apologies that you are so unsatisfied.

All I want is for you to help fix this problem under your warrenty. I can take close up pictures of every inch it. I do not know why the center of it started to come apart.

I am asking for help with your product.LePan Support on 6/28/2012 3:38 PMHello Customer,Unfortunately the kind of damage to your tablet is not covered under our one year limited warranty.This damage that has occurred to the tablet can be fixed for the fee of $150 USD, plus the shipping costs.

Collins on 6/28/2012 2:09 PMOkay in the picture you have please indicate where you see pry marks. In the thousands of cases you handled if someone prys apart the case made of plastice there would be pry marks. The only place on the case that is coming apart is shown in the picture. As I have indicated before there is no damage done to the case. The screen came popped up because of.the buldge at the bottom of the tablet. I am smart enough not to pry open a 4 month old tablet. Heck even my 5 year is smart enough not to do that. please tell me of any other way I could have done this and not show ANY damage.LePan Support on 6/28/2012 1:08 PMJohn,Our apologies that you feel this is unjust. Having issued thousands of units, fielded thousands of support cases, and replaced a number of damaged units, none of the previous cases have ever fallen apart as your tablet has. This decision was not made lightly, and we consulted the highest of possible authorities within the company. Their determination was that your tablet appears to have been mishandled, and someone likely attempted to pry the unit open. We can reach no other conclusion based on the picture that you have sent. Once again, our apologies that this is not covered. We can offer you a replacement for a fee of $150. We do appreciate your business, and apologize for not being able to offer anything further. John L. Collins on 6/28/2012 12:58 PMPlease tell me your definition of accidental damage. My definition is that some type of accident has to occur. The tablet has not been mishandled, dropped, thrown, kicked, or any other kind of action that would damage it. There are no scratches, scrapes, chips, or any other damage marks on yje tablet. No games are played on it. It is kept next to my bed where only my wife uses for reading and Facebook. I will not spend $150.00 to repair this when it should be covered by your warrenty. If you will not stand by your workmanship then the only accident on my part is trusting your products and your company. Please decide if you want to keep me as a valued customer and honor you warranty or that you are happy with taking my money this time and the review I will write on Amazon about this product amd your company.LePan Support on 6/28/2012 10:30 AMHello Customer,unfortunately the kind of damage that you've described is not covered under our one year limited warranty, which does not extend to accidental damage. We offer only a manufacture warranty good for 1 year from the date of purchase (this cannot be extended or enhanced in any way).This damage that has occurred to the tablet can be fixed for the fee of $150 USD, plus the shipping costs. If you would like to pay this fee to have your tablet replaced we can process an RMA for you. Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here and if you have any questions.Thank youLePan Support on 6/27/2012 4:18 PMJohn,Because we are unable to determine whether or not this is manufacturing error or user error, we are forwarding your case to the corporate office. They will let us know how to proceed. Our apologies for the delay. John L. Collins on 6/25/2012 6:44 PMHello. Myname is John Collins. I bought the LePan tc970 back on February 8, 2012. Everything was fine (except that it charged very slow) until it started falling apart. There is a bulge at the bottom seam and it will not close back. That caused the screen to start coming up on the bottom left. Now it won't even turn on.Please help with this problem.  _______________________________________________________________________________Please everyone be very careful when buying this tablet or any other  Le Pan product because you will be going through the same problem  I just went  through.  Please read all the reviews on Amazon or were ever  you can find one.  I pray that you don't end up with a 200 dollar paperweight like I just did.	
101	1	1	4	3	3	4	4	4	0	3	1	4	Sorry I Purchased This Tablet! I've had this device since January 2012.  In March 2012, Le Pan replaced the unit because it was defective.I thought the replacement unit would work flawlessly.  I was wrong.  It has a big problem as far as I am concerned.  I can not watch HD videos on Youtube.  When I attempt to watch HD Youtube video the tablet just buffers, and buffers, and buffers.  The buffering issue is so annoying I just give up trying to watch the video, search for another video, get more annoying buffering, etc., and never get the experience of viewing HD Youtube video on the tablet!  Now, if I watch non-HD video (film quality of non-HD is horrible) I am forced to watch super poor quality, fuzzy looking film.I used to be thrilled about this tablet.  My view of this tablet has taken a 180 degree turn in the opposite direction.  I do not recommend this tablet at all.  I thought by saving money and choosing this cheaper tablet I got a great deal.  I was wrong.  Next tablet I buy is going to be an Ipad.  Apple produces reliable devices.	
102	4	3	3	4	1	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	Best price and value for such a LARGE tablet! Surpassed my expectations!  Great price, great product, great deal!  Upgraded to ICS in about 20 minutes and havent looked back since.  Would buy this product again if I needed another one.  Love it.Screen is larger then imagined; the tablet is super responsive and the graphics are as great or even better then that of the Ipad.  I purchased the Le Pan 2 tablet, 32gb Micro-sd card, tablet case and screen protector all for less then HALF of the cost of an Ipad.If your questioning this product due to its lack of notoritiy, please dont.  This is a great product and the ONLY thing holding it back in any way is its lack of familuarity in name.I expect this company to continue to do great things and build on its reasonably priced products... if I could buy stock in Le Pan I would.	
103	0	0	0	4	0	3	4	4	4	4	0	0	Very Disappointed. I received the first LePan and the power/awaken button was defective.  I read online where this is the most common defect.  So I sent it back and it took 8 weeks to receive a new one...at my cost.  The replacement worked well for 2 weeks and then the screen cracked.  It still worked, but then cracked again in a totally isolated area from original crack 4 days after first episode.	
104	3	3	4	0	0	4	3	4	3	4	3	4	Great product for the money. This tablet is a great product for the money, especially with the ICS upgrade. I am a techie so I had no problems upgrading, I might even root this device later if needed. I got to install Flash through the .apk file and that works great too. It works great with a bluetooh wireless keyboard too.Only wish if the device drivers were signed by the company. It's kinda suspicious looking that these aren't signed, so I ran a system wide malware-virus scan after I installed them and even pre-scanned them before installation. Nothing found, but it's more professional to have signed distributions.Also, having a USB port would be nice (besides to 30-pin to USB) and a better camera than the 2MP.Overall, would recommend this to anyone looking for value for money.	
105	0	4	4	4	0	4	2	3	4	0	0	0	Returned for second time. I thought this was a good deal and had good reviews. Unfortunately, after 6 months of ownership, I am already on my second return. It will not make it past the LePan logo and just sits there until the battery is dead. Same problem with the first one, and same problem my buddy had who recommended the product to me.I would say avoid this product. I've had an IPad for the same length of time without a problem.	
106	0	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	4	Didn't work. after hassling with this thing for three days I finally sent it back and haven't considered a tablet since. word	
107	0	0	3	4	2	4	0	3	1	1	0	0	Disappointed!!! Even after expanding the memory to a 16gb, with a recommended memory card for tablets, it constantly froze! Every 10 minutes I had to reset it. So disappointed!	
108	4	4	0	0	1	4	1	4	0	0	0	0	Awful customer service/multiple problems with device. I am not one to write reviews but I have had so many problems with this device and cannot seem to get any help from Le Pan. 90% of the time the volume button does not work and even if I try to manually turn up the sound, it stays on mute. Also, it freezes a lot the time and I cannot access Netflix or Hulu. I submitted a help request on the Le Pan website on 11/29 to try and get help with these issues. I have also tried calling them on multiple occasions, only to wait on hold for 30+ minutes and have the call just drop, no one from Le Pan ever answers. Finally, on December 13th I received an update on my website inquiry stating "NEED TO CONTACT NETFLIX NOT LE PAN". Which answers the netflix issue but not the freezing or volume issues. Maybe they are just busy from the holidays but to make someone wait two weeks and then not respond to all issues is unacceptable.Basically, this is now just a  very expensive e-reader as I cannot access anything else and cannot get any support from Le Pan.	
109	1	4	4	1	3	4	4	4	3	0	1	4	not for me. It's been so long since I returned it that I can't remember why I didn't like it.  I know that it wouldn't let me watch some videos I wanted to watch from Network sites, and couldn't be used for Hulu.	
110	4	4	3	1	3	1	4	4	4	4	0	4	Tested an turned out to be a lemon. Got my tablet on xmas eve so an so far so good my only problem is the camera is jus non practical an my YouTube is anting crazy butoverall its a great tab :-)SO TODAY IS ONLY THE 27TH AN MY TAB HAS COMPLETELY FROZEN :-( !!!!!!!!!

She never owed a computer so i figured this would be great for her to have to use Facebook with etc ...My Boyfriend and Myself set up the tablet on Christmas and it worked fine. But on the second day of using after trying to set up wireless connection ( which was fine ) The screen staled on me while using it. Im use to that because I have an Android phone, so I shut it down and restarted it. it happened a few more times I kept quickly fixing it and moved on.what really upset  me was on the 3rd day, i was at work and my mother wanted to surprise me by writing something on Facebook. And she couldn't get it open . It was stuck on the Home Screen but still had the "Un Lock image " on it. And for anyone that uses Android products that's NOT suppose to happen . And For sure not on the 3rd day using it.I read the reviews first and thought it was a good purchase for my mother since she will just use it for Facebook and may be shopping (when she learns how... LOL ) but it was mistake. Had to return it and get refund, now im going to get the Google nexus instead and im sure that would be better.Maybe i just had a bad one,  it unfortunate though kinda disappointed.	
112	1	0	0	1	0	0	4	3	4	0	1	3	I don't get it.. Maybe it's just my le pan that sucks. I'm not technically savvy so I won't give you a complete run down on the pros & cons. What I will do is list my problems with this tablet that I recieved for a birthday/Christmas gift last year (2011). I researched a lot of tablets before choosing this one. I don't  have cable access so I wanted something I could watch TV on but no such luck, the tablet will start the program & then either freeze or shutdown OR the program won't recognize the android programming (Hulu for example). It does the same thing with youtube & other video formats. Also, even with added memory (sd card) I've still run out of space with my music & pictures and the videos...forget about it, it will shut off while you think you're still recording & you won't  know until you're  finished because the camera is front facing. I don't know if there is an upgrade but if so I'm in dire need of one...very disatisfied.	
113	3	4	3	4	0	4	4	4	3	4	0	4	Worked great for 3 weeks. Purchased this for Christmas for my daughter. It worked great out of the box, and had no issues with connecting it to my home wireless network.After about 3 weeks, it decided to quit holding a charge. We tried resetting it numerous times, and leaving it on the charger overnight, still no good. I am returning it for a refund, and I hope that goes better than the expected life of this tablet did.With the other bad reviews I see posted here, my guess is the batteries they are installing in these units are not up to spec, and are therefore quitting prematurely. I cannot recommend this product, until the power issues with these units are resolved.	
114	0	4	3	3	0	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	Awesome tablet!! Love my tablet its the best! The price was reasonable and the screen resolution is wonderful. I downloaded my Bible and love reading it on my tablet :-)	
115	0	1	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	2	0	0	one star rating is too much for this product. This is the worst product that I have purchased. It goes to the web page it wants to, turns on when it wants, is not at all consistant so that you can at least fgure out what went wrong. At times it is super sensitive to you touch other times you can pound on it and nothing happens. I can not send an email from my email account and most of the time I have to fight it to even access my email. I do not recommend this product to anyone. I almost paid nothing and that was too much.

Since I'm new at this I didn't want to spend alot, so when recieved it I used it as much as possible and I still haven't used all it's features. Thanks, PLittle	
119	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	It's a great tablet. It actually does almost everything that a IPad does but at a lower cost. I bought one for myself last year and loved it so much I bought a second one for a gift. It's easy to use, easy to download apps, easy to buy anything. For a great 9.7" tablet, you need to get this one.	
120	4	0	0	1	4	4	1	0	4	4	4	4	it works great i will tell every one to buy this tab ....because its the best tab i had so far. i think its better then the ipad. I hope more people realize le pan is one of the best tabs out there.....very fast tablet so many things you can do atOne time and always go back to what you was working on before great tablet thanks le pan for making a greatTablet ...just to let y'all know that will be the le pan 2	
121	4	4	0	1	4	0	1	4	4	4	4	4	Le Pan ll 9.7" I have spent several weeks researching and trying to decide whether to get a IPad or a tablet.  Finally because the price was so much better I ordered the tablet.  I am so glad that I did, I am very pleased with the Le Pan ll and I have yet to find anything wrong with it.  I can still read my yahoo mail and I have access to the same games that I played on my laptop.  I would order this product all over again.	
122	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	Great Tablet. I'm using my tablet to write this review. I love it, plain and simple. I'm new to tablets but it's so fun and easy to use. I like the large keypad. A great investment.	
123	4	0	3	0	4	1	0	2	4	4	1	3	Too bad they don't stand behind it! (1) The first thing I have to point out is that the ONLY poorly made part of the tablet is the charge cord, the cord literally fell apart, IT takes  30 pin connector that is just slightly different from most 30 pin connectors available on the market so you pretty much have to buy it from Le pan ( they should just improve the design and give them to anyone who bought the tablet that came with their original cord.(2) THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE TABLET IS TOP OF THE LINE( EXCEPT THE CORD...WHICH FELL APART )(3) Their tech "support" has great hours......if you work there , if your a customer their hours are terrible! 7am-5:30pm MON-FRI when you call expect to spend a LOOOONG time on hold, eventually you will talk to a real live person, they will be polite and seem helpful, but then when the tome comes you can expect to receive an email giving you a lame excuse about why they REFUSE to honor the guarantee.(4) again it's a great tablet .......until you have an issue with it then it becomes a waste of hard earned money,	
124	3	0	0	0	4	0	0	4	1	2	4	4	Works for me. Have had this tablet about 1 1/2 years now......never had a problem.  Wifi, power button have always worked properly.  Updating to ICS took a couple of tries, but is now completed and system operates with no hiccups.  Use this tablet mainly when on road trips and for the GPS function.  Sits in the car hooked to an inverter when at home....and sitting in a car in the hot Texas sun hasn't caused any problems or issues.Sorry that other people have had problems.......I paid about $100.00 more for mine that the going price now.  Had I watched I would have bought my wife one of these instead of the stinking Kindle (I don't like them, but she seems to be happy with it).Anyway, thats my two cents worth.	
125	0	1	3	4	4	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	Waste of money. I bought this tablet in December 2011` and from day one it never worked.  It would get on the internet once but you could not navigate to another page unless you turned off the tablet completely and then started it up.  Then you could go to another website, but only one, then you have to restart the tablet again.  I contacted LePan about the problem four times and them kept emailing me fixes that never worked.  They never offered to exchange the tablet and now since the warranty ran out they want to charge minimum of $100 to send it back to them and see if they can fix it.  What a joke!  Don't waste your money.  Customer service is awful.	
126	4	1	3	0	0	2	4	4	3	1	1	4	Good hardware for the money. Not much else. This is a good tablet for what you pay. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have probably mentioned, the support is nil. You're better off going with a more main-stream name brand.  Inability to keep the hard keys lit for low light reading is just one of the several annoying things that will probably never get fixed due to this product's zero support from the manufacturer.	
127	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Love mine! My husband and sister has an Ipad 2 but I am very pleased that I can upgrade this up to 84 GB. It's very easy to operate. Mine has Google Play on it and I can download games with no problem. So easy to use.	
128	1	4	4	0	4	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	dont buy these brand. USELESS USELESS USELESSthis brand make a low quality product. at first i was so impress how cool it look. once i start using it i notice that it hard to use because product doesnt have a company app such as app or andriod so it need to be upgrade often … like very very often. some app can download and some cant not. it is terrile. after a few months the charger broke. and it charge $20 for F*** charger. buy apple cheaper in long term	
129	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	4	2	2	4	4	Looking for an Android tablet? Why not A200! I picked up this tablet three days ago from my local Best Buy after a series of bad experiences with a Kindle Fire (The internal SD was corrupted? HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?) and some off brand tablet called Cruz (Don't get me started...). I can honestly say that I have never been happier. The hardware itself is fantastic, with specs identical to the A500 (minus the 5.0 megapixel camera, but then again, who wants to take photos with a slab of glass?) and most other Honeycomb (Android 3.0) tablets. I prefer this tablet to the iPad 2 I used for several months. I feel like I have a full computer in my bag! The full USB port is a fantastic option to have, I can see myself using it for a 3G card (if they are supported I do not know.)The modifications made over stock Honeycomb really help make the user end experience unique, with it's different and interesting method for multitasking.Also, the thing launched at the end of last month and Acer is already preparing an ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich, or Android 4.0 to you non geeks) rollout? I love how supported this device is, even in its infancy.So, if you're looking at Android tablets for a certain price range, pick up an A200. You will not be disappointed!	
130	2	3	3	4	3	4	4	0	4	3	4	4	great tablet. This is very good tablet, of the three we own this has quickly become my favorite. I could care less about a rear camera. I still use my laptop for serious work but for playing games, surfing the internet this is great. Do not let the lack of a so so rear camera push you away. You would probably never use it.	
131	2	4	2	0	4	4	4	1	4	0	2	0	dead. Bought this for my birthday four days ago. Used it yesterday morning, went to turn it on at night and won't turn on.  Nothing I can do to turn it on. Will return it, I guess.	
132	2	3	2	2	4	2	4	4	4	1	2	4	Great tablet until you update to ICS. I bought this tablet, took it home and updated it to 4.0.3 the next day I noticed whenever you open the side bar half the screen cuts off and flashes. I returned it, bought one somewhere else after taking home and an hour after updating got the same glitch. I decided to play around with the display tablet after returning mine and their display tabby had the same glitch. I would have loved the tablet if I wouldn't have that glitch. =/	
133	0	0	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	0	Please do not buy. After 3 days of usage. The tablet is not even switching on. Am just shocked that these kind of low quality tablets are being produced by reputed brands like ACER. A big thumbs down..	
134	3	0	2	4	4	1	4	4	3	3	3	3	Almost 5 stars! This is an incredible product.  I've had very few problems with it, most likely due to the heavy usage and many apps I have installed.  My pro's and con's are below:pro:1)  I have an android phone.  I was able to access my google account on the tablet and download all of my apps (free and paid) onto the tablet at no cost.2)  The screen is vivid, colors great, and speed incredible3)  The battery life is INSANE!  I just finished a 10 hour trans-atlantic flight and watched .mpg movies on my tablet for over 9 hours of the flight.  I loaded them onto memory cards and used a program called Mobo to watch them.  I did turn the screen brightness most of the way down to conserve power.Con:1)  Does not drip charge or usb charge.  No way to charge it except to plug it into a 110 outlet.  I don't know if there is a car adapter that works for it, I've seen some advertised, but they looked hokey so I didn't try them.2)  Does not recognize SD card or jump drive data that was not put on through the tablet system.  I had to USB connect to my computer to move files to and from the memory and cards in order to have them available for later use.  This means, you can't take the camera memory card and download the contents to the tablet.  Seems like it would be a simple software update if the manufacturer wants to get 5 stars.  (hint hint)	
135	3	3	0	2	4	4	4	1	4	4	0	0	Tablets are NOT real computers.Beware. Problems:1. Can't use it as a "flash drive" because Windows doesn't recognize it as a device to save to when working with MS software on your main computer.  This makes it worse than a $10 flash drive.2. Software is buggy.  Icons that are supposed to exist on the home page to add apps are not there.3. Home page shuts down in about 2 seconds, requiring constant push-button re-starts4. USB port won't charge; you MUST connect with A/C adapter when working with it, or battery drains real fast.5. Get a netbook for about the same price with all the features you want.6. Won't run real MS Office, so you limp through any real work.7. No Return policy by manufacturers, so if when you've had it for a few days and realize its horrible shortcomings after working with it in a real-world situation, you're screwed, even if you want to upgrade to a real computer that actually works.8. This and apparently all other tablets are designed primarily for playing crappy video games like Angry Birds on a bigger screen. Your phone can do everything else at a fraction of the cost and weight.9.  I'm putting my A200 on ebay, and will probably loose 50% of the $300 Acer ripped me off for this useless piece of hardware10. Then I'm buying an HP netbook 10.1" screen with true Win7 and all required ins/outs, for the same amount of money, that's the same size and weight (with optional keyboard), 100x the memory, and about $100 more.11. Don't make my mistake of listening to advisors who said a tablet is better than a netbook.12.  BTW, netbook sales and quality are rapidly increasing, as people discover the shuck and drive perpetrated by computer manufacturers trying to get people to get with the latest toy.13.  Now 7" screen are the hot thing, and even worse than 10.1 in screens.  I looked at one, and said this piece of junk is 35% bigger than my phone and does nothing better, unless you want bigger pictures to look at-- whoopie.  I got work to do.	
136	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	4	Love it!! I have to say I absolutely love this tablet!! This is my third tablet, I have had a Pandigital and a Le Pan and out of all three this tablet is far superior to the others.  It is so easy to use and the graphics are fantastic. I did a lot of research before buying this and I have to say I am thoroughly pleased that I bought this.  I am a very avid reader and I love reading books on this, what I also love is that I am not limited on books I can get.  Although I do use it for other things, I do mainly use it for reading.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an ereader or a tablet, I would buy this over the Ipad in a heartbeat!! The expandable memory is awesome for recording movies and taking along camping, or to sporting events to keep my kids entertained.  The videos play without problems and graphically are really clear and the battery life is amazing!!! So if you are looking for a very affordable, durable, wonderful tablet, this is it. I have never left a review on either of the other tablets that I had, but couldn't wait to on this. I bought the Metallic Red and absolutely love it, plus it matches my favorite colleges' colors.  I hope this helps if anyone is condsidering buying an Acer, I don't think you'll be disappointed.	
137	2	3	0	0	0	4	4	4	1	2	0	0	Defective LCD Screen. After only a few days of use, the LCD screen cracked for no apparent reason while sitting idle on a table.  The Acer warranty does not cover defective LCD screens and would not replace it.  Also, the speakers are poor and can be difficult to hear.	
138	0	3	0	3	2	4	4	4	0	3	2	0	Beware - Do Not Purchase! I purchase this tablet Feb. 2012. The tablet has worked all fine and great until just recently. When I say recently I mean 2 weeks after the 1 years warranty expired. It also seems many other users/customer are experiencing the same problem. The problem is the screen or digitizer goes crazy, and it appears the glue used to hold it down isnt good enough, like at the bottom edge. the screen becomes un usable.. apps opening on their own, cant press keys or letters on keyboard. as with other users its same symptoms along the bottom edge of screen is problem. press there slightly and apps will open close etc etc. I contacted Acer support, no recalls, no known defects known of this type..support rep, said my warranty expired, and basically SOL. So I paid for this tabled 350$ used it maybe 6 times when traveling over past year now it is junk. Unacceptable!! Contacted Acer support again requested to speak with level 2 support. Finally they admitted that this is a known problem and would repair the tablet at no cost to me and even though its passed out of warranty.	
139	0	1	1	4	2	4	4	1	1	2	3	4	Great except for wi-fi. Like this product except for wi-fi.  Using the same wi-fi router for both computers, we can watch You-tube on our laptop but we can't using our Iconia tablet.	
140	3	0	0	2	3	4	4	4	1	4	3	3	Heavy but Nice. Pro: I got mine used so was super cheap. Quick speed, Google Play, adjustable sensitivity, responsive, micro usb and USB. Screen is the perfect size for reading online books/comics/manga. bluetooth. netflix works great. good screen resolution, seems durable.Con: No HDMI, not obvious way to lock screen in one position (downloaded an app), Apps pretty limited compared to phone, lots of pre-installed software. speakers are pretty quiet, brightness is limited. gets pretty warm (not in a case).overall 8.2/10	
141	4	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	1	2	3	Good but some small issues. As far as the OS goes it runs on Android and you either like Android or you don't. This isn't going to sway you away from iOS. The hardware is very good but sometimes the touchscreen can be unresponsive for a few seconds but then it works perfectly. This doesn't happen often but is annoying when it does.	
142	4	2	2	2	4	4	2	4	1	4	0	0	Very disappointed. Before buying this item I did a lot of ~shopping around~ to figure out what to buy. The bottom line is the 2 major things that sold me on this unit was the 10.1" screen and the fact, according to Acer's own website, that the unit was capable of being wi-fi and/or bluetooth tethered via a tethering capable phone (which mine is).A couple of things happened while attempting tethering: 1) When trying to tether the unit via WiFi - the A200 does not even see the SSID (even tried to set it up manually to no avail), and 2) When attempting bluetooth tethering, the A200 actually shows that it is "connected for internet" via bluetooth when in fact it actually is not. I did a live chat with an Acer tech yesterday and after they had me go through their routine of resetting the A200 (which I had done prior to contacting them) - their final word was that it must be a problem with my tethering software. That would have been ok except that I also own a bluetooth enabled laptop and with the same software they are telling me is flawed - was able to tether my phone to my laptop for internet using BOTH methods (WiFi & bluetooth) with no problems whatsoever.The ability to do this was a must for whatever tablet I purchased so this thing is basically useless to me. Additionally, another problem that Acer does not wish to recognize about this product is when you attempt to shut bluetooth off, the unit simply hangs up for about 10 seconds - then reboots itself.The things I have mentioned here are discussed heavily in Acer's own forum, yet they refuse to acknowledge that the unit has issues. Not everyone's tethering program in their phone can be flawed and others, like me, report the same thing: able to tether to other units but not the A200.

I will be brief with this as most everyone else has already captured my praise for this item.I picked up a refurb A200 from 1SaleaDay for $160 and this thing is flat out perfect for me in regard to the combination of utilization for business and entertainment. It is fast, works well on ICS 4.0 (with an upgrade arriving soon from Acer for JB 4.1), and basically offers you everything you could want. With a battery life between 7.5 and 9.5 hours (on my usage), it gives me all the juice I need to get through a few days of sporadic use here and there.Quite simply, I highly recommend this unit to anyone out there looking for a rock solid 10" tab that can basically do it all for you.	
144	2	2	3	3	3	1	1	0	4	4	2	2	given wrong info. it isnt too bad, but the specs are wrong, it doesn't have a rear facing camera, ur description says it has two a front and back, well it doesnt, just a front facing one, this was the reason i purchased this so u are misleading people.	
145	0	3	3	3	2	0	0	1	4	3	2	3	Somewhat disappointed. Seemed to be a good choice, good reviews at a good price. Unfortunately, I kept having trouble with the touch screen which was very erratic. Sometimes it worked great, others hit or miss. And sometimes it wouldn't work at all. Tried to get used to it, but it was just too much aaggrevation to put up with.  It could have been just that particular unit, but I didn't have the stomach to try another one. Switching to another brand.	
146	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	It was as advertised. Me and my fiance were both amazed at how fast it is.  Instead of using her Samsung Galaxy 4S she use the tablet when sitting in bed now. Highly recommended

148	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead? UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are "post-paid" and "pre-paid."  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can "suspend" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.	
149	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Wasn't going to upgrade but... This will be short since I'm typing on an iPad. If you read or are planning on reading on your iPad, the new iPad is the only way to go. I had no idea the old screen was straining my eyes until I used the new one. I can read much more now without feeling like my eyes are tired. Magazines are amazing to look at. I feel like the jump from gen 2 to 3 has been bigger than 1 to 2. The display is that much of a difference.	
150	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	0	3	4	4	4	A very good purchase. as a first time tablet user, I am simply blown away by the new stunning ipad. The screen is simply gorgeous and the clarity and crispness of the text is literally like reading a paper in hand. Can't really describe it as you have to see it to believe it. I feel like I can touch the text itself instead of reading them through a screen. If you use ipad as a book reader, I highly recommend you to get it. The text quality do improve a whole lot. But I think regular gallery pictures and videos will look the same in your regular non-retina devices.I couldn't seem to find too many retina-ipad3 specific apps out there in the wild that I am interested in. I am not a big gamer so I will have to wait to see how other productivity apps will look in this stunning new screen. Flipboard and Pulse do look absolutely amazing and the browsing experience is even more elevated here.After lots of research, I believe the only sure smartcover for ipad that is guaranteed to work is the Apple Smartcover. So I purchased one with it and so far happy with my decision. I did get some minor scratches on the back already so I am rushing to get a Smartcover partner to protect the backcase. I am the kind of guy who aren't usually careful with gadgets but this ipad just have the magic draw to get pamper.Can't comment too much on the battery life, but it still hasn't drained out after days of playing. So it looks good! Wish there is a wireless wifi charger for this baby like the rumored Samsung S3 has. then it would be perfect! Since ipad does not have any usb ports, it comes along with a wall charger. But I didn't find it as a hindrance at all given its long battery life. My overall interaction with my new ipad is an absolute joy as everything is so easy to use and very intuitive. Kudos to Apple for making such a gorgeous, simple and clean, and absolutely intuitive product.Before settling on the new ipad, I have been debating whether to go for android tablet or not. I am a very happy android smartphone user so is not allergic to the android ecosystem. But the android tablet world is a different beast. Most of the android apps seem to tailor more to the smartphone so won't look as good on the tablet. Hard to find Android 4.0 Ice-cream sandwich even on the latest android tablets so the current bunch look dated. Granted there are a lot more hardware options to choose from and specs maybe more powerful, but none match the quality, ease of use and overall look and feel of ipad. The other factor that seal the deal for me is that the resale value of ipad is so overwhelming strong that I can safely buy it now and upgrade it later in the future, knowing that my current device will still fetch a pretty penny.For would be first-time tablet/ipad users, I highly recommend going for it. It is going to be a wonderful experience that you have to own it to believe it. Given the high resale value of the currently existing ipad2 and how the new ipad costs pretty much the same as before, upgrading it is not a bad idea at all. For those people on the fence about getting an ipad or android tablets either existing, or the upcoming Samsung Note or tab tablet, or even the highly anticipated Asus transformer infinity, you own it to yourself to give the new ipad a try.	
151	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3 Generations in and Still No Equal. Pros: Slimmer design; 4G & Wi-Fi; personal hotspot; beautiful screenCons: Still no usable USB portsBottom-Line: like the iPad 1 and 2 before it the iPad 3 is the must have device of the decade, period! The tablet has become and extension of my arm!My Apple iPad.  What started out as a nice to have toy, has become the virtually indispensable tool for making sense of my increasingly hectic life.  There isn't a day that goes by when I am not on the device; from checking my e-mail, to sending and receiving text messages; from checking my calendar to playing games with friends and family; from posting to Facebook or Twitter to listening to NPR's morning edition; reading the latest news from the AP, New York Times, Politico, NPR, or The Daily, to listening to music on-line or stored on my hard drive; from logging into my business network via VPN, to talking to me daughter via FaceTime, almost everything I need to get done on my laptop I can now do on my iPad.Now Apple has released the iPad 3 and those of us who use the iPad 2 are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  I was satisfied with the iPad 2, but never wanting to be behind the technology curve I decided to order the newest offering from Apple in the exact same configuration as the last; in other words I ordered an "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi+4G" version.The iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G FactsOn the surface the iPad 3 is not demonstratively different from the iPad 2.  Featuring an Apple designed Dual-core A5X, low power, high performance processor, the 1.44 pound (1.46 pounds for the Wi-Fi + 4G) iPad 3 is a tad thinner than the iPad 2, though the screen size stays the same.  Other than that, there are no physical changes to the tablet.  Under the skin however, Apple has included a Retina display that offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch.  The other notable change concerns the front and rear facing cameras, which now offer 5MP autofocus resolution and HD video recording.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 4G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.37" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The iPad 3 (available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 4G LTE: UMTS/HSDPA/HSPA+/DC -HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 3 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (1080p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.Re-syncing with iTunes or iCloudThe iPad 3 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 3 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 2 showed up on my iPad 3, since the last time I "physically" backed up the tablet via iTunes, right before I started using iCloud to perform back-ups.So I finished the restore via iCloud which took close to three hours to complete.  No big deal; I plugged the tablet into A/C, started the restore and went to bed. I did restore all of my music (15GB) via iTunes however, and that took considerably longer than 3 hours to accomplish; again another overnight chore.  I suppose if I purchase more iCloud storage I could back up everything including my music, but I see no need to pay for additional storage; 10GB would set me back $20.00 a year; 20GB = $40.00/year, and; 50GB = $100.00/year.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account; I also have my iPhone 4S and iPod 3rd Generation synced.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to "Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data."VPN AccessThe iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G VPN can be togged on and off at will.Personal HotspotNew to the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is the Personal Hotspot, which allows you to share the tablets' cellular data connection in order to connect computers and other devices to the Internet.  Nice!!!First ImpressionsLike the iPad's that have come before it, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, play a game, post to social networks, log into my business network and access my workstation, read e-mail, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business as well as personal e-mail.Today while typing out this review on my iMac, I fired up my iPad 3 and I played Hanging with Friends with an old friend in Maryland, held a text conversation with a friend visiting Vegas and another in downstate Illinois, read e-mails from 3 separate accounts, posted to Facebook & Twitter, while listening to music via Pandora! Last night while grilling BBQ chicken on the patio I streamed music from my iPad to a portable Bose speaker via Bluetooth!Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I started using the iPad I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 4G and, instance access.Heat & NoiseThere has been much to do about the heat the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G gives off, and while I have noted that the tablet gets a little warmer than its predecessor, the degree of change is in no way uncomfortable.  So, I have to ask what all the fuss is about!?ConclusionsI like the iPad; it is the must have device of the decade, period for anyone who wants to stay connected!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99), or an increasing number of similar applications.  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office, though again via Apps that is changing.  For instance I purchased an App last week that allows me to access our Microsoft SharePoint 2007 environment and manipulate documents contained in Lists and Document Libraries.  This is a big deal as more and more business content is shared and or stored on SharePoint in a number of businesses.  The availability of VPN on the iPad makes this possible.There are also a number of very good RDP applications available in the App Store that will allow me to log into my workstation at the office and manipulate date via VPN. As the number of Apps that mimic , and or reproduce the business environment increase so too with the iPad's usefulness as a business tool!Hands down, the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! The new Retina display has made considerable difference in the reading of text on the tablet.  Whereas before my eyes would start to hurt after just 15 minutes of book reading on the older iPads, not I can read continually without discomfort, the text acuity has improved that much!Yes, the entrance fee ($829.00 for iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain "cool" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.	
152	4	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	1	3	4	4	Happy with my new gadget. The new iPad is a wonderful addition to my gadget family, and this means a lot to a gadget geek like me!	
153	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Love my iPad! I got my iPad for use in my MBA program, which uses all eBooks. Not only do I use it for that, but I use it for most of my email and web searches. I bring it everywhere. I was worried about the cost of using it on the cell network, but virtually everywhere I go, including our community center and some restaurants, I am able to access a free wireless network.I'm disappointed that Adobe hasn't made Flash for it. I purchased QuickOffice for business productivity since there isn't a MS Office package for iPad. It's not quite the same, but it works.I haven't done anything with photos yet. Other than that, I've found that 16GB is plenty of space.	
154	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	0	Frustrations with apple. I have an iPad 3, and several Mac computers. I really wish apple would answer the phone when I try to contact support. I only use the phone after exhaustive attempts to use the website support.	
155	3	4	4	4	3	0	2	0	1	1	3	4	Pretty good but slow. It's good. Downloads can be slow. Lots of ads that aren't asked for at inappropriate times. It's always evolving and you never know if you purchased the best one.	
156	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	0	4	3	3	Great---but still not quite ready to be amazing. Tablets are, arguably, luxury toys for rich people. They are cool toys, but the truth is tablets aren't yet QUITE as amazing as they need to be to fully justify their price and status.The screen. Let's take the glass half empty view. A 9.7 inch screen is still a small screen compared with a laptop or desktop. Only the prevalence of smarphones allows us to perceive it as big. Ten years ago what would people have said about an amazing computer---with a big 9.7 inch screen! And it costs more than many desktops! And 264 pixels per inch is record breaking for a medium/small screen screen but it's still low compared with almost all modern smartphones. So its screen lacks the size of a desktop or laptop screen and it lacks the extreme clarity of a smartphone screen. You COULD argue it's the worst of both worlds.If and when tablets move to 300 pixels per inch, they will be truly amazing, mind blowing, earth shattering devices. Ultra clarity like a smartphone but much more size! Such devices might be so amazing that they cause smartphones to go extinct.In the meantime, while the new iPad is a major step in the right direction, it's still not quite ready--like a Thanksgiving turkey that was taken out of the oven just a bit too early.	
157	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	Excellent iPad. I am totally pleased with this product. It is even more than I hoped for. I take it anywhere I go because it is so lightweight and convenient. Thanks Amazon	
158	1	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	Most of 64GB Memory Unusable.  Buy the 16 GB Model if any. From the time the iPad was first introduced, customers have been complaining about the "Other" category arbitrarily expanding to consume the available memory.  To date, Apple has never explained this problem or made any effort to fix it.  I have never been able to load more than half the iPad before the "Other" category suddenly appears and swallows most of the remaining memory.  I have the 64 GB iPod Touch and it easily loads all my stuff in under 50GB.  The iPad can't load half of it in "64GB".MANY customers have been complaining about this problem for YEARS and many have offered solutions on community forums, none of which work.  Apple remains silent.  It takes 10-20 hours to load the iPad depending on how many times you have to restart iTunes, which is frequently.  Since August 8th when I started counting (exactly two months now) I've tried to reload mine 33 times.  That's right:  33 times!  I tried many more times before I started counting.  I've gotten used to glitchy and unstable software from Apple, but Apple has been ignoring people's pleas for assistance with this problem for years now.  I'd hoped they'd make some effort with iOS 6, but NO help at all.  The 64GB iPad is a rip-off since half the memory is unusable.  I recommend not buying more than the 16GB version and just using it for basic games and simple email.If I only wanted 16GB, I'd say the iPad works fine.  It's way over-priced for what little you can do with it and I suspect most users would be happier with a small notebook computer that actually functions.	
159	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	very pleased. What's not to like especially when I can work from home, watch a movie, read a book, browse the internet and use it in the classroom with educational aps for the kids. Haven't used the camera yet.The teenager is constantly trying to get her hands on it. But I do confess that when I cannot figure something out the teen can, so its a trade off at times.	
160	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	good product. this came reallly well and works perfectly , arrived on time and came with no damages , the only thing i dont like is that the ipad 3 came without headphnes -_-	
161	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Best ever. The Ipad was. Every thing I expected. I held off from getting one as long as I could but glad I made the decision.	
162	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	Sealed in original box indeed. Excellent delivery as promised and ALL arrived in original SEALED box as advertised. Significant improvement of the retina resolution as compared to iPad 2, though a little heavier. No problem to use the sleeve bought previously for iPad 2.	
163	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	Apple iPad 3rd Generation. We love our iPad 3rd Generation it is more than meets our expectations!  It is so much faster than our computer.	
164	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	Flora. The product is in accordance with the description. I am a student and I buy the iPad mainly for study, so I think it's a good deal, thanks.	
165	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	Just what the doctor ordered. Meets all expectations. Works great with my wi-fi system. Whole family uses it all the time. Would recommend it to everyone.	
166	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	This is a great iPad. I actually ended up selling this iPad back to Amazon because I needed more space on the flash drive, but for most people this is more than enough. There is no need to purchase the most recent version as the Apple iPad 3 is a very fast and capable tablet	
167	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Love this iPad!! had it exchanged 4 times at the apple store. I love my iPad!! only thing that bugged me is that I had to get it exchanged 4 times because there was always a defect with it, first one the screen was extremly yellow, second one had a line going through the screen, 3rd one the screen was yellow again, and then the 4 one had dead pixels, then the 5th ipad I got was perfect!!, I dont mind exchanging my apple products out for replacements but I think they should have better quality control. other then that I love my iPad, its the best, nothing can beat an iPad.	
168	4	4	1	1	1	4	4	2	4	3	4	4	You will not regret buying this, from a first timer here. Yes, it's that amazing.After  dealing with Windows for decades, seeing the iPad make you realize, Apple has always been about making great products, while Windows was always about selling you stuff.Buy this, I've used it for months and haven't even thought of looking for a manual, did it even come with one? Try that with a Windows computer. Even today, to set up one, unless you know *exactly* what to do, which is usually the *OPPOSITE* of what Windows recommends, the lay person can be driven to tears. Shame on Windows. To This Day, I get calls to set up peoples Windows from friends.This is why Apple makes Windows look like the bloated OS that it is. Buy a QWERTY keyboard if you are doing extensive text input, like writing a book. I Love this thing. You will too.	
169	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	Love the Ipad. Ipad is great.  I would have preferred the Retina version, but we opened it and are stuck with it.  Seller was fine, I should have read more carefully.  Good item, good shipping.	
170	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	The best Christmas present ever. I got this for Christmas this year. I love it. It's just like a computer except with an easy touch screen. I hope everyone had wonderful holidays. In fact I am typing this review on my ipad 4. This baby has a redesigned retina display. I'm not sure why apple is not selling the ipad 3 anymore. Could you guys leave me a comment explaining this please? Anyway this would be a great device to get your child or teenager for x-mas or any time of the year really. The only thing that makes a gripe is the price. It is still worth it though. This device is also great for school, playing fun games through apps, and for work and job related business. Even if you want to have a little fun whether on car rides or long distance air flights. You'll love the ipad 4. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS. Most have already pasted though. P.S.: Before I forget, HAPPY NEW YEAR! I accidentally made a mistake! SORRY! I clicked on the 3rd generation ipad instead of the 4ourth. They look the same though.	
171	4	4	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	I really love the iPad! The tablet is perfect for me and my needs.  I am really happy with my choice. I am able to watch movies, listen to music and post on Facebook and Pinterest.  Plus the apps I have downloaded. Very happy with my choice!	
172	4	3	4	4	4	4	2	3	4	4	4	4	I Use It For Everything. One device, I can organize my notes, read books, surf the internet, track my finances, I even downloaded a 3D modeling app so I can work on my 3D design when I'm not at my computer!	
173	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Great! This was a great gift. It has many awesome things you can do. The IPad is very cool and fun.	
174	3	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	3	1	4	4	Obsessed!! Product was EXACTLY what I wanted.  Shipped quickly.  I spend everyday on this tablet.  Never opening my laptop again LOL	
175	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	Excellent! Pros:Quick start up, easy to navigate and use. To put it in one word, convenience. We use it for multiple tasks, but mostly for browsing, communications, watching videos and some games. Basically laptop light. The major pro to me is the quick start up.Cons:Small screen, sometimes I find the words hard to read and the zoom function is not as good as on my laptop. Does not support some non-Apple programs. Not useful for word processing or heavier duty functions. It's basically laptop light (which is both a pro and con).I think of it as a super remote control that I can carry around the house, taking the place of the simpler functions of my laptop.	
176	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	1	4	4	I Pad 3rd Gen. Performs as expected.  Big improvement over the 1st generation.  This might be the best camera we have out of 5.	
177	4	4	2	2	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	Great. This I Pad is just what I was looking for .Easy to use and navigate . Just the right size.	
178	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	Ipad love. I brought this iPad to Austria and left it there because my family there liked it SO much! Worth to buy!	
179	4	4	2	4	4	1	3	3	4	4	4	4	Great. I already own a Kindle Fire, but this allows everything the Kindle does plus more! Wish I'd bought it first, but my husband loves the Fire as it's small enough for him to carry on trips!!	
180	4	4	4	1	0	0	4	4	4	4	2	4	This was a gift I sent to someone else. Gift receiver was very happy, but I wish this product was priced lower. I can get comparable functionality in an android table for lot less. Steve Jobs makes money even from Heaven :-)	
181	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	I finally took the plunge. After listening to several of my iPad owning friends rave about theirs I finally bit the bullet & bought one.  I am early on in the learning process but I have to admit that it was much easier to get up & running than any non-Apple technology product that I'd ever purchased.	
182	4	2	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	4	4	Ken's I pad review. I pad has lived up to its reputation! Great purchase, and it does everything I bought it for. Very pleased with it.	
183	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	3	4	Definitely a premium product for a premium price. I received my refurbished iPad 3rd generation from Web Marketing Direct for $330. It was definitely a good deal, considering the device had minimal damage and a newly replaced screen. I was set on getting the 3rd generation since it included the Retina Display without having the infamous lightning dock connector found on the newer iPad. All in all, I was very pleased with the item I received, now on to the actual device:Screen:I didn't believe all the hype at first about the Retina display, but in fact it is all true. The display is definitely stunning and features probably the best screen on any tablet, although I think the Google Nexus 10 still wins in terms of pure sharpness.Build:As stated in the review's title, you can definitely feel the premium material that was used to put this device together. I wouldn't go so far as to call it durable though, which is why I recommend you get a case and screen protector.OS:Here is where the iPad falls short. At least for now, Apple's iOS 6 is the iPad's most visible weakness. It looks and feels stale, despite the iPad's beautiful screen. The static icons just don't cut it anymore, especially if you have used Android 4.0 or above on a tablet. Hopefully iOS 7 will improve upon the software, but from the initial previews it seems to be more or less the same.Battery Life:This is where the iPad excels most notably. The 10 hour reported battery life proves to be all but true, even with the brightness and high levels. The fact that iOS is extremely simple with little to no graphical animations is what optimizes the iPad's great battery life.Productivity:I know that most people buy tablets for recreational use, but sometimes people choose to integrate it with their work life through e-mail and word processing. Unfortunately, the iPad isn't really great for either, considering that the keyboard accessories from most manufacturers are overpriced and Apple's own iWork suite is far too minimal at a high price. Also, true multitasking with multi-window support is just not present and further shows iOS' limitations.Overall, the Apple iPad is a great device for media consumption while delivering excellent battery life. If you are not able to fork up the heavy price, there are definitely cheaper options available such as the Google Nexus 10 but they arguably don't offer the same 'premium' look and feel as the iPad does.	
184	2	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	0	4	2	4	Great deal. Quick shippping.. great price. Had a few scrathes like indicated, but hey thats fine I got a great deal on it. I do wish it would have come with the charger though.	
185	0	4	0	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	0	0	Save your money. No support from Apple or the seller for product. Do not buy this product from Amazon. Apple will not service or replace it because someone has messed with the insides. Mine has completely died and no one will do anything about it. A major rip off. The company who sells it through Amazon says that it can only be returned within 30 days. It begs the question, who messed with the machine and why. Save your money and go to an Apple store.	
186	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	1	4	4	4	4	Merry Christmas mom. Merry Christmas mom.  I know this is exactly what you wanted as you picked it out. Now we will all know that our iPads are just where we left them as you have your own.	
187	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	I LOVE MY IPAD 3. So far, perfect! So happy with my new ipad 3 64gb it was very well taken care of, no scratches no dents.. simply love it!!	
188	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Loving my Ipad. was very satisfied with my ipad i purchased. it was in great condition and came with a new case that i didn't even expect to recieve. it even surprised me by how good of a condition it was in. everything looks brand new. I LOVED IT. thank u.	
189	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	excellent! the product met my expectation. i bought a used iPad 3 but believe me it came in as if it had never been taken out of the box. it had no sign of wear and tear, its battery life is excellent, its operations are sharp and the microphone is loud. i initially complained about the picture quality but when i checked with my friends that had the same product, it was practically the same and now i am used to it. and concerning the shipping, it came in supper fast(received my package earlier than the estimated date). the only thing is that iPad does not have USB port like some other tablets but with time u find ur way around that, lol. i love my iPad because it has all the features i wanted in a tablet.	
190	0	0	3	4	0	2	4	2	1	4	0	0	Cracked screen after 3 weeks of minimal use without any form of abuse to the product. Within 3 weeks of moderate use (and handling with carefulness) the screen cracked and shattered at the top where you turn on and off.  This was not dropped or abused in any way.  Thankfully Amazon stood behind this purchase.  Again, this cracked with out dropage or any misuse.  I don't believe this was at the fault in any way of the shipper, but after further research appears to be an Apple issue.	
191	3	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	3	4	Happy with iPad. This is our first iPad. The new Air is 3 or 4 hundred dollars more than this one was. I think this one is very good buy for the money.	
192	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Ipad from Amazon. It's an ipad! This device is a tool for the mind for sure! It is well made. It is easy to use. If you have ever used another tablet (like an android) you will appreciate how easy to use an ipad is. I would recommend protecting this device with a case like the Griffin so that the ipad will work for a long time to come. This device is a very versatile tool!	
193	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	Not from this seller (Game On Grove City) I love the iPad itself and find that as long as it's in very good condition it's a great purchase from AMAZON.  With that being said, in December I was visiting a friend in Baltimore and left my iPad on the kitchen counter downstairs.  The home was burglarized overnight and they took the iPad and some jewelry left on the kitchen sink.  For the police report all I needed was the serial number and GOGC would not help.  I even incentivized and told them if they helped I would re-purchase another one from them but…crickets.I purchased another one but I wouldn't recommend this seller.  Also, I learned if not buying from apple to remember to get tracking tools like PREY once it's arrived.  Thieves know its almost impossible for a buyer to get their apple products back once they been stolen.	
194	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	4	4	Love it. I am very satisfied.  The screen is in pristine condirion.  Everything worked perfectly! Great buy!  Only downside - I am not keeping it, as it is for my sister.	
195	4	4	2	0	4	0	4	4	3	0	0	0	will not charge. The porter on this item does not charge, seems to be on the inside.  Ive tried several different cords and makes no difference.Wish I would have known not to buy a '3rd generation'.	
196	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Apple iPad MD370LL/A (32GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, White) 3rd Generation. I like this iPad very much! It is fast, and it arrived in very good condition, no scratches, no evidence of misuse at all. It did have the previous user's Facebook account stuff still on it. I had to take all that stuff off, and it had several updates that were under her name and password. I had to call Apple tech support to get those removed. Other than that, I couldn't be any happier with this iPad.	
197	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	So far a great purchase. For the price it was in very good condition. A few scratches and nicks on the corners of the back cover. But I have a leather cover on it so you don't see those nicks on the corners. So far it was a good purchase for refurbished iPad three.I traded in an iPad one which was in excellent condition but slower than I wanted. I don't think I got what it was worth but all they offered me was $79 on Amazon.I'm satisfied with the upgrade.	
198	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	4	0	3	4	Good condition as described. Arrived on time. No defect as described and work perfect. I like the information about the warranty as well.Trust worthy!	
199	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Ipad is great. Likes- almost everything about it is great.dislikes-battery life could be betterI would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet.	
200	2	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	4	4	great product. I am please with this purchase, it was ship as described and looks great. thanks for a great product! Five-star	
201	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	I-Pad 3. I totally enjoy my I-Pad.  It doesn't replace a full size computer or lap top but it's very convenient as well as portable.  Mine was used but it certainly is everything I hoped for and operates very much the same as my I-Phone so there wasn't much of a "learning curve" to begin using.	
202	2	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	3	4	1	4	So so. What kind I say, its very limited in everyway compared to android. Heavy, did not enjoy it at all. Ended up with the Note 8 and haven't looked back.	
203	1	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	1	3	3	3	The screen is so much more noticeable /clearer compared to the iPad 2. Apps are now made specifically for this iPad 3 HD. The two most important features as compared to the iPad 2 and the new iPad are the amazing resolution and this speech to text dictation.I am now using the dictation to write this review and it seems so much better than Nuance Dragon Natural Speaking. Combined with the new resolution, which is much noticeably better than the iPad 2, it seems worth the upgrade. If you sell your iPad 2 you are only lose about $150; Apple products hold their value. Apple has created a system for apps, which makes which makes the new iPad available to download your current apps in four times the resolution; Web browsing and Kindle texts looks so much clearer on the new iPad. If you are a blogger or WordPress, Joomla or just an every day emailer there is no point in having a external keyboard for the new iPad. The voice to text dictation is a huge bonus.Cons:Although the front facing camera is adequate for Skype and FaceTime the resolution is not as good as other cameras for taking clear pictures. Another con compared to the iPad 2 is that the battery takes very long to charge. Although the backward facing 1080P camera may seem good on paper it is not as good as one would think. Like me, not many people use their iPad for recording videos anyway.Also, like the iPad 2 the Wi-Fi antenna is not nearly as good as a laptop or desktop computer.16 GB is really all you need, most people don't even use half of the space. Streaming music or videos does not require any extra GBs, however if you use it as your main camcorder, download video/music directly to your iPad consider getting more space or more than 16GB. If you are a big traveler and have the money go with the LTE version, otherwise the Wi-Fi version is all you need.	
204	4	3	1	4	4	4	4	1	3	2	4	4	Amazing Retina Display. I had the original iPad for a couple of months back in 2010 and really liked to browse the web on it. When I heard the new one is coming out, I preordered the white ATT 64GB from Apple website. I received it on the launch day two weeks ago, and I am really enjoying the new Retina display ever since. It is such an improvement over the first iPad, and I really enjoy reading different things on it.Color Choice:My original iPad was black, but this time against all the online suggestions, I went for the white version. My reasoning was, if you really want to read something--either web or text--having black borders only makes your eyes hurt even more. Printed books do not have black borders, and yet they are the easiest to read. I am happy to report that my intuition was right, and the white version is easier on my eyes for reading purposes. Maybe it is not the best for playing video games or watching movies, but the white border actually helps the reading. In addition, it is not completely white and has a beautiful pinkish hue that looks like pearl from some angles.Connectivity and Speed:I could connect to both of my router 2 GHz and 5 GHz channels via Wi-Fi. Out of curiosity, I inserted my modified T-Mobile SIM card into the GSM spot, and it did pick T-Mobile internet but worked only on 2G (Edge) mode. It works very well with Apple TV 3, and I was able to duplicate the iPad screen with my 40" LCD. However, the screen aspect ratio was only 4/3 and not 16/9.This new iPad is much faster than my original iPad. I can even browse the web much faster on this version let alone other programs and games. I ordered the Camera Connection Kit alongside this iPad, and it can import and read my 24MP pictures from Sony A77 without any problems.Cameras:My original iPad didn't have any camera, so it is so much fun to use FaceTime and the back camera. Both of them are quality cameras, although I don't see much use of the backside camera. I have my iPhone for that application. Maybe if you want to shoot movies and edit on the iPad itself, it is worth to have a good quality rear camera.Problems:I use international keyboards sometimes to enter foreign characters into the search, and I encountered several crashes when changing keyboard in Safari. One time I was writing a paragraph in Notes app, and suddenly the app crashed because I accidentally clicked on international icon. The problem was, I lost all the text I typed. I think the new iOS needs some minor bug fixes.Verdict:It is the best tablet I've ever used. It is fast and responsive, light, and it has an excellent LCD which is easy on your eyes. Does it worth the price? It depends. Like any other Apple products, this is made from high quality materials, and it is stylish. Paying the price is hard, but once you start using it, all the fun begins. Hope you could find valuable information in my mini review.	
205	4	3	1	4	1	4	4	3	2	4	4	4	Nice Tablet, have a Kindle Fire to compare. This is a very nice tablet.  The screen is very clear and detailed.I have a Kindle Fire, so will compare that to the Ipad3.  I know they are priced much differently, but I have a Kindle and was questioning if the Ipad3 was a good upgrade.First the obvious:Apple has a bigger screen.IOS vs AndroidMain menus:The IPAD main menu scrolls smoother between screens and when opening applications.  The Kindle default Amazon interface is kind of lame and too simple, however I use a side loaded app called Go Launcher on the Kindle.Go Launcher has onscreen buttons for home and back (which is the same type of interface on an Android).  With the Ipad you have to press the hard button over to the side to go back to the home menu.On screen buttons like with Go Launcher are nice, example... if I am in email then open a url this will open up the web browser.  When I want to return back to that email I simply just press the onscreen back button while in web browser and this will take me back to the email I was just looking at.With the Ipad if you are in email and press on a url the web browser opens as normal, but you have to press the hard button to get out of the browser and back to the app menu, and then press the email app.  This seems kind of redundant to me.  Another option with the Ipad3 is you can hit the home button twice to access your open apps and press the email program.The Android onscreen navigation buttons are more intuitive for this purpose.Screen:The Kindle Fire screen looks very good but looking closely (12 inches away) I can still see the pixelation on smaller pictures.The Ipad Retina is for sure more clear and sharp.  The pictures are more vivid and detailed.  Text looks much sharper.Internet:Ipad3 web browsing is faster than the Kindle but there are still some occasional delays when scrolling down a webpage on the Ipad, but much less than the Kindle Fire.  Using the Safari browser is more responsive.  The larger screen on the IPAD3 is way nicer for web browsing.  With the Kindle Fire there is a lot more side scrolling going on and moving around the screen to browse the web.The onscreen keyboard:Ipad is very responsive and I don't feel like I have to guess if the onscreen key I hit was registered.The Kindle was not as responsive.  While the onscreen keyboard is good, there times when the Kindle just seems to hiccup and not register an onscreen key.Email:The Ipad built in email integrates with my MS Live account.The Kindle built in email doesn't work with MS Live, you have to get a different program which really sometimes does not pull up new email and the navigation is clunky.Music streaming:Pandora Radio works fine on both.  The Ipad has one speaker, and the Kindle has two for stereo affect.  The Kindle sound is very good for the price, but when tilted horizontally the speakers are on the left side and one of the speakers gets covered up when held up.  I think the Ipad3 sound is better, however the speaker faces away so the sound can be distant when propped up.Video streaming:Netflix on the Ipad3 is way better; the movies look clear and stream in HD.  The Kindle movies look blotchy and appear to be playing at a lower resolution.Google maps and locationing:Kindle Fire has no location positioning for locationing apps.The Ipad3, has no GPS, but can still use wireless positioning to locate the Ipad location like in Google Maps._____________So the Ipad3 is way better than the Kindle, surprise!!  My only gripe is there are no onscreen navigation buttons to jump to other applications.  Pressing the hard button is not a big issue, but I rather only use that button sparingly.I like the Ipad3 for most tasks including email, browsing the web, streaming movies.I like the Kindle Fire for compact use and I prefer the smaller size for traveling lightly.	
206	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	AWESOME!!! SUPER VERSATILE!!! THE NEW IPAD IS SOOOO INCREDIBLE! I love using it for my gaming school work and with my photography. I bought the camera connection kit with it witch lets me import photos up to 19 mp to my ipad directly. I use it the Zaggfolio for word processing which is also awesome. The retina display is incredible and the iPad its self is blazingly fast. I also use airserver and play videos and games to my macbook pro. I recommend this as an upgrade from the ipad 1 or 2. But only if you use your iPad ALOT!	
207	4	3	1	4	4	1	4	4	1	4	1	1	Horrible Device For Basic Business Needs!  Too many restrictions! I've had my new iPad for a couple weeks now & I am constantly having road blocks doing basic everyday functions.  Don't be fooled by the slick design & nice screen display, this device has so many limitations compared to other cheaper devices.I think it's good for an entertainment device but it's horrible for business. Here's why....The iPad does not allow a basic way to attach a file to an email.The iPad does not allow a way to upload any content through a web browser. Example, if you wanted to upload your current resume to a career site, there is no way for iPad to do so.  You would have to use your computer or an android device.I'm shocked in 2012 with a hi tech device I'm unable to do the most basic everyday functions.I tested out some cheaper android tablets & they all seem to do the basic internet functions with no problem; even the Kindle Fire!?. Email attachment, upload & download files through the web browser.  All web content is not hosted through iTunes so the restrictions is a big headache.  If you do any business through email & web browsers, do not travel without a laptop.	
208	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	1	1	All that sizzle and no steak. I own an Apple Mac Air, iPod touch, and work on a Mac Pro at school, and I have to say, the iPad is my least like Apple product.  iPad is essentially a bigger and more expensive version of iPod touch plus the optional cellular function, which you have to pay at least $20 each month for the service, so that you can use the navigation function (cheaper just to get a GPS with antiglare screen).  First, my biggest complaint is the lack of flash function.  It is true that I know about that limit before my purchase, but it is only when I started to use iPad, I realized how many things it couldn't do without flash, such as watching Amazon online stream movies.  It is really stupid that an iPad, which is targeted as a tablet, could not do flash.  Second, I thought it could at least play DVD if I have the right USB adapter, since I have an external DVD drive, but after searching online, I realized it could not do that either, because some format issues.  It really drives me nuts, because what is good about retina display if you can't watch movies, and I am not about to pay extra money for movies on iTune.  Then, it is the multi-tasking function, I really thought that was a joke. Originally, I thought multitasking means that you can open two apps and have them side-by-side on the screen, and I was dead wrong.  First, there is no side-by-side, and second, once you switch to another app, the previous app (such as safari) stops.  For example, if I am watching a dateline story streaming on CBS, I cannot have it play in the background and use other apps.  There are also small things like I can't use the Apple magic track pad with iPad (wireless keyboard works fine).  Overall, the new iPad sucks compares to other Apple device.  I feel for the price I paid, I am getting a mediocre device with multiple restrictions (mostly for business reasons such as no flash so that you have to stick with iTuen for movies) and no special talent other than the retina display.  Anyhow, I hope my love for iPad could increase a bit after Siri being available on new iPad in OS6.*UPDATE*:  another disappointment about new iPad - it takes ages to recharge.  I use the 10W USB power adapter and I closed the smart cover (sleep mode) when I was charging the new iPad.  I tested the battery at 3 different times, and it is roughly 10% increase per 35 minutes, which means it will take roughly 5 hours and 50 minutes to charge from 0% to 100% full, which is very close to PC world's report.  On another note, the techs at Apple store told me that apps and bluetooth draw a lot of power, so that I should close them if I want to save battery.*UPDATE 2*: on the postive side - I downloaded the GPS drive app and it actually works without data plan.  The catch is that you have to get the direction while you have internet access, and then it will take you to your destination without continuous 3G/4G or wireless connections.  However, you won't be able to get another direction to a new place unless you have internet, nor can you find the nearby restaurants, gas station, etc without internet connection.*UPDATE 3"(8/2/12): Amazon Prime videos are now available on iPad!!  The video quality is pretty good, but I don't think it is HD quality.*UPDATE 4*(9/27/2012): I updated my iOS to version 6, and I like it so far!  Siri is now incorporated to my iPad 3, and I've been talking to her ever since.  Youtube app is gone from my iPad, Apple says their contract with YouTube is expired.  So for now, I have to use Safari to watch youtube.  Google maps is gone and replaced with Apple's new map system.  It does voice turn-by-turn direction, but I haven't really tested it out yet.  As for other newly released apps, for some strange reason, iPad 3 owners did not get to have passbook app.  I guess Apple figures that I won't be carrying my iPad around to the airports, concerts, or watching a movie, or going to a ballgame, which I do....*UPDATE 5*(10/28/2012): Apple just announced few days ago that they have a new iPad (for convenience, let's call it iPad 4) - by looking into the technical specs, I think the only two changes are: the chip (upgraded to A6 from A5), and the power adapter (from the 30-pin to lightening connector).  In the future, someone has to comment on whether the lightening power adapter is able to charge the iPad faster than the 30-pin adapter. Otherwise, I don't see any benefit of changing power adapter, as the the lightening charger won't work with previous versions of power docks.  People who are interested in buying the mini iPad should also know that the mini iPad does not have retina display (it is 163 ppi), and thus no HD.  On a separate note, I've been testing the Apple's new map system recently, and the results are so far so good! I think in some ways it is better than Motion X HD (a paid third party GPS app).  To summarize: First, the color system in Apple's map only has four to five colors, but that is not a issue to me, as it looks plain but clear.  Second, you can only get one voice: the voice of Siri, but it sounds great, so no complain.  Third, Apple's map gives much earlier warning compares to Motion X in terms of the next direction.  I had many experience that Motion X was late on telling me to take an exist or make a turn.  So kudos to Apple's map.  Overall, I don't know why there are so much criticism against Apple's map (most complaint is that the map system is not as mature as Google's).  I mean, it is possible that Apple's map won't work for you if you are going to somewhere remote, but you can always double check on Google's map using Safari.  I think if you mainly use Apple's map in places other than country side, then you should be fine!  After all, you don't need to pay extra (Motion X is $10/year) for voice navigation.

210	3	4	4	4	4	2	3	3	3	4	4	4	WOW. This is my first ipad. It is unbelievable!!!! I keep learning more things you can do on it. It is an amazing product. Gotta go to learn more.	
211	4	3	4	4	1	4	3	1	4	4	4	4	1080p support is worth the upgrade. I have been extremely happy with my purchase of the iPad 3. I have a lot of movies on my home server in 1080p and with the help of third party apps, they play brilliantly. My partner has never liked his iPhone 4 because it is too small, but I have to literally take the iPad from him. I also have not used my desktop since receiving this thing. My desktop is an awesome $4500.00 dual loop liquid cooled customized beast. Lately it has just been sitting there.I think I see another iPad 3 in our future. I hope they don't go up too much higher before we get another one.	
212	4	4	1	4	3	3	1	3	2	4	3	4	My Apple iPad 32GB. This product meets all of the criteria I was looking for in a portable tablet, the features are easy to use for novice such as me-----I am not the britest star in the universe when it comes to technology however this Pad makes me shine!!LP--Memphis	
213	3	1	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	0	4	4	iPad 3 = Still King of the Hill! I've owned android tablets in the past, and...for what it's worth, there is some very good hardware out there. For instance: Google Nexus 7, and the Asus Transformer...however. After owning the Google nexus 7, I didn't enjoy using it. The hardware was VERY nice, but there are some things I didn't like about android. Yes, it's more customizable...but it's not user friendly like the iPad is. I realize that the "best tablet" is what you use it for, but I find that Apple's ahead of the game. The iPad 3 screen is absolutely magnificent! As for the problem with it heating up, I live in Florida. High 80's is a nice cool day...I don't have ANY problems with heat. However, it does get warm. I guess I don't find it to be a problem. After using it for 3 hours, it's still way cooler than your laptop would be...Alright, well that went on longer than I wanted it to...but I hope this cleared somethings up for people that are still shopping.Long story short: Android is fun/iOS is usableWritten from my iPad 3	
214	4	3	0	4	4	1	1	1	4	2	4	4	WOW!!!! Thank you for such good service. I just signed over the AppleCare+ in my name, good until 3/15/14. Everything you said about the product is true. The service you provided was beyond my expectations. Fast, I ordered it, and 3 days later received it!!! Will purchase from you again. Thx a lot!!!	
215	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	1	4	1	3	4	AMAZON listed supplier. I purchased my Ipad 3 from a source listed on Amazon.  It was delivered quicker that they estimated and I assume it was new because it came in a sealed original box and was listed as new.  I do have some suspecian because of some unusual chats showing up when I tried facetime. Othe  wise I am very satisfied. Buying from Amazon makes it easy and merchandise is great.	
216	4	3	1	4	4	3	4	4	3	0	2	2	Is this REALLY the Newest Model? The ad on July 21, 2012 reads it is the latest model and quotes the Apple latest model price on Apple's web site today, $829 as the price from which it is discounted- But then the ad here also states it has the A5 processor- The latest generation IPAD has an A6 processor. I want the latest model with the A6 processor. Because of the conflicting information in the ad, and given the specificity of the statement that the processor is an A5, I am afraid to purchase from this ad because it might be a gen 3 for essentially the price of a gen 4, but does not have the gen 4's processor.	
217	1	4	4	4	4	3	1	4	0	4	3	3	Good with one exception. The product itself is fine but as I ordered a black one I expected a black one. Only the face is black, the case behind is silver/aluminium colour and gives off reflections which I was trying to avoid.	
218	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	2	2	1	4	4	Worth Every Penny. I knew this would be nothing more than a toy. I didn't know that I would become tethered to it. If you're looking to be productive (school / work,) a netbook may be better for you. If you're just looking for web surfing, games, magazines, radio and podcasts, and overall entertainment, treat yourself with an iPad.	
219	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	3	3	3	iPad. I am using it now. It arrived quickly, still trying to figure it out. The quality is great. I have a lot to learn. Thank you	
220	3	4	4	4	4	2	2	3	4	4	4	4	iPad is easy. My iPad is easy to use, easy to recharge, and easy to synch with my iMac.  I just remember that it and my iPod are the 'children of my iMac.  My photos, music, and podcasts are now available in several formats.	
221	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	3	4	4	good. good design. it is not too heavy, and it works so fast. hh h h h h h hh  h	
222	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	3	0	4	4	4	Excellent product. I'm very satisfied with the item that I bought to you. Thanks for you services, I hope to bought again to you.	
223	4	4	1	4	4	2	0	4	4	4	4	4	None. I received the product on time and with All the characteristics included as the web pageThe service from the web was nice and was updates alway	
224	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	0	4	4	Exceeds my expectations. I can't tell you how much I use this for work, for play, to take photos, to record meetings and witness statements, etc.  Great product.	
225	1	4	4	4	2	4	4	2	3	3	4	4	As expected, exceptional. Yes there are other tablets on the market, but Apple's seamless integration between devices (iPhone and mac air) made this the only sensible option for me.Performs as I expected it would and have used more than I thought and is invaluable for both work and home use, some of the educational apps have been a great way of encouraging additional homework for my 7 year old,	
226	1	3	3	4	4	0	4	3	0	2	4	4	really love it. I have a Samsung Galaxy 2, Kindle, and a Windows tablet. Of all of them the Apple IPAD 3rd gen with the 64GB is by far my absolute favorite.	
227	4	4	4	4	2	2	4	3	3	4	4	4	I Pad 3rd Gen. Performs as expected.  Big improvement over the 1st generation.  This might be the best camera we have out of 5.	
228	2	4	4	4	4	1	2	4	4	3	4	4	Great Product! I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband, and he absolutely LOVES it! He takes it with him everywhere he goes. The picture is outstanding and the sound is great too. I do recommend getting a Life Proof case for this!	
229	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	4	Great upgrade from old version. I've had every iPad that came out and this one is awesome. I had the iPad 3rd generation wifi only for a while and I was needing to use data on my train rides and decided to get a new iPad. Settling for a iPad LTE carrier was easy for me. I chose AT&T; because I already have the iPhone 5 under that carrier. The speed is amazing and I love it!	
230	4	1	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	Apple is Apple. Apple is always superior with these gadgets. Especially now that they are more affordable. What i didn't liked was the way it was packed to another box. There were no added security in it. Then top and bottom box was not taped...	
231	1	4	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	0	3	4	Love My Apple Ipad Purchased From Amazon./com. I am thrilled with my Amazon purchase of an Apple IPAD MD366LL/A and the numerous capabilities it offers.  It operates very similar to the Apple Iphone so I had little difficulty in setting it up and getting started using it.  I am elated that I can surf the internet and the larger screen/monitor allows me to read the results with little difficulty.  It was a definite plus to learn that I could download a free APP which allows me to import and read my previously purchased Kindle Books as well as use it to purchase and read  IBooks.  The Ipad with its larger keyboard is very handy for text messaging. When I want entertainment I can play games.  The Ipad is much easier to tote around than a laptop computer, yet, it performs many of the same functions.  To sum it up, I just don't know why I didn't buy one before now.	
232	1	3	4	1	3	0	3	3	4	3	2	2	Pricey but overvalued. As long as you don't mind the computer telling you what you are going to do this is a good device to own. I used some of the available apps in my business and find it very convenient.	
233	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	iPad. The only bad thing about my iPad is that I can't stay off of it.  Does everything I want it to.	
234	2	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	4	3	2	4	Great deal. Quick shippping.. great price. Had a few scrathes like indicated, but hey thats fine I got a great deal on it. I do wish it would have come with the charger though.	
235	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	Use it everyday. My ipad is wonderful.  I use it everyday.  I wish I would have gotten the one that is internet assessable everywhere.	
236	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	3	2	4	4	4	I'm very happy with this device. It works good, is helpful  and i use it very often. I would choose it a second time. Thank you.	
237	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	Everything I Need for Work and Play. This device is amazing!  It replaces my need for a smart phone.  I love the GPS as I am directionally challenged, and do a lot of driving for my job as a private tutor.  I also love the ability to check and respond to emails while on the road.  Additionally, there are so many apps that help me stay organized and productive with my mobile office.  It's also great for when I need a break from work.	
238	4	3	3	2	4	4	3	4	1	1	4	4	Great product. I'd like to have the latest model, but this one is doing everything I've needed so far. I used to want to deal with the other brands of tablets, but after trying other people's ipads I like how a lot of things are easy to do.	
239	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	apple is awesome. first tablet i have owned and i love it. functions really well and i love how it works with my other apple products	
240	4	4	4	4	3	0	3	4	4	4	4	4	Changed my life. What's here to say about an iPad that hasn't been said already? It's totally useful and awesome. It will probably change your relationship to your significant other because now you can internet whenever and that will annoy them. But oh, the things you can do with your iPad!	
241	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	0	3	2	4	4	Great Ipad Deal. The ipad was listed as refurbished,  but I couldn't tell.  It seems new no marks or scratches and works like a dream.	
242	4	4	2	4	4	4	1	3	0	4	4	4	I was scared to buy this on-line But It Was Great! I had not purchased a used product on-line before, I was concerned - but the product was in perfect condition and everything worked great!	
243	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	4	4	4	4	Love it! I got an awesome deal on this ipad!  It came in perfect condition (like new).  So happy I made this purchase!	
244	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	2	4	4	Satisfied. Considering this was refurbished, I'm happy with product.  After all, I realistically couldn't expect brand new but it works as good.	
245	3	4	4	4	4	1	2	4	3	4	4	4	Insanely fast, easy to use, productive, and most important of all, fun. This review is coming from a person who bought the original iPad and did not upgrade to the iPad 2 when it came out.The iPad is a remarkable device. I find it to be much more useful than any laptop out there for many reasons, including portability, application availability, and ease of use.One reason why the iPad is so fast compared to laptops is due to the fact that it uses flash storage memory, or in other words, there are no moving parts inside the device, like a laptop would have with a typical moving hard drive that would eventually die after X number of years.I am not an Apple fanboy. I do see where they have some flaws. But if you're wondering if the iPad is worth the money, it absolutely is. You get what you pay for, and the iPad is a perfect example of it.I skipped the iPad 2 because they did not come out with the retina display, which makes everything, most notably text, much more sharp then it has been previously. If you do any fair amount of reading on the device, you need to get the third generation iPad, and don't look at the previous models. It will be entirely worth it, and you will not look back or regret your decision.And for the people who are confused why Apple chose not to name this device the iPad 3, I would like to help with a brief explanation. Apple currently has many products where they do not have a numbering system in the official title of the device, like the iPod, iPod touch, MacBook, MacBook Pro, Apple TV, and so on. It's simply labeled just with the title of the device, and the way people distinguish it from previous models is to simply refer to it as the first, second or third generation, etc. Evidently they are going to do this with the iPad now as well, and you can count on the fact that the next iPhone that will be released will not be called the iPhone 5. :-) I partially digress, but for the people who are wondering about this with any possible confusion, I hope this clears some of it up.I could get into all of the features that it has, but if you're looking for an overall device that does everything extremely well and fast, look no more and get this third generation iPad. It's easy to use and fast, but most importantly, it is fun and productive.	
246	4	3	4	4	4	1	4	2	4	4	4	4	Amazing Retina Display. I had the original iPad for a couple of months back in 2010 and really liked to browse the web on it. When I heard the new one is coming out, I preordered the white ATT 64GB from Apple website. I received it on the launch day two weeks ago, and I am really enjoying the new Retina display ever since. It is such an improvement over the first iPad, and I really enjoy reading different things on it.Color Choice:My original iPad was black, but this time against all the online suggestions, I went for the white version. My reasoning was, if you really want to read something--either web or text--having black borders only makes your eyes hurt even more. Printed books do not have black borders, and yet they are the easiest to read. I am happy to report that my intuition was right, and the white version is easier on my eyes for reading purposes. Maybe it is not the best for playing video games or watching movies, but the white border actually helps the reading. In addition, it is not completely white and has a beautiful pinkish hue that looks like pearl from some angles.Connectivity and Speed:I could connect to both of my router 2 GHz and 5 GHz channels via Wi-Fi. Out of curiosity, I inserted my modified T-Mobile SIM card into the GSM spot, and it did pick T-Mobile internet but worked only on 2G (Edge) mode. It works very well with Apple TV 3, and I was able to duplicate the iPad screen with my 40" LCD. However, the screen aspect ratio was only 4/3 and not 16/9.This new iPad is much faster than my original iPad. I can even browse the web much faster on this version let alone other programs and games. I ordered the Camera Connection Kit alongside this iPad, and it can import and read my 24MP pictures from Sony A77 without any problems.Cameras:My original iPad didn't have any camera, so it is so much fun to use FaceTime and the back camera. Both of them are quality cameras, although I don't see much use of the backside camera. I have my iPhone for that application. Maybe if you want to shoot movies and edit on the iPad itself, it is worth to have a good quality rear camera.Problems:I use international keyboards sometimes to enter foreign characters into the search, and I encountered several crashes when changing keyboard in Safari. One time I was writing a paragraph in Notes app, and suddenly the app crashed because I accidentally clicked on international icon. The problem was, I lost all the text I typed. I think the new iOS needs some minor bug fixes.Verdict:It is the best tablet I've ever used. It is fast and responsive, light, and it has an excellent LCD which is easy on your eyes. Does it worth the price? It depends. Like any other Apple products, this is made from high quality materials, and it is stylish. Paying the price is hard, but once you start using it, all the fun begins. Hope you could find valuable information in my mini review.	
247	4	4	4	3	4	0	1	2	3	4	4	4	Too much fun. This is my first iPad and it is AWESOME. I have a friend that just got a brand new iPad 2 and we compared the resolutions side by side, and the difference is slight, but noticeable.  If you have the iPad 2, it's useless to get the 3.. just my opinion.As far as the hot spot is concerned, yes it gets warm but nothing that is annoying or inconvenient.  People who complain are blowing it WAY out of proportion. All you need to do is look at the tech specs to realize why it does so. There's a lot going on to power this thing in a tiny space which is why people bought this thing in the first place! don't let it discourage you. Plus, when you put on a case on it, you never notice it.Great product, very functional and a lot of fun.

249	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	Love My iPad. The product itself is great of course! I loved , loved, loved the ordering process and the promptness of my product arrival!	
250	4	4	3	4	4	1	4	2	4	3	4	4	Awesome retina display. One of the best purchases I made in the recent past. I love the retina display on the new iPad. I have been using it on my iPhone 4S, but it's even more eye-popping on the iPad. Watching movies on the iPad is such a treat that I have not been turning on my plasma TV anymore.	
251	3	4	3	4	4	1	1	4	4	0	1	1	Very disappointed. I bought my new ipad through apple.com. Very disappointing that it drops my wifi connection too often. It can never work until i restart my modem. All my other laptops and other devices works fine. Voice dictation does not work as it cannot understand most of the sentences. Very disappointed. I may return this and buy a laptop which has tons of memory and speed.	
252	0	3	4	4	4	2	1	4	3	2	0	0	Verizon (and AT&T;)  iPad Buyer Beware. I want to preface my review by stating that the iPad is a remarkable product that is worthy of a five star rating. My one star valuation is specific to the new Verizon iPad which in my opinion contains a major flaw detrimental to all consumers unwary of Verizon's tactics.The Verizon iPad is equipped with a sim card that permits cell data usage by subscription. With my AT&T; iPad 2 I am able to subscribe and unsubscribe at-will one month at a time. This is the way a cell data subscription should work. The Verizon iPad does not permit this type of usage. If you cancel a monthly subscription for cell data with Verizon that cancellation permanently inactivates the Verizon sim card. The only remedy is to go to the Verizon store to obtain a new card. I have had to do that twice since I purchased the Verizon iPad and each time it is a major time consuming inconvenience and problem.My first stop at the Verizon store took an hour while the customer service representative insisted that I could not replace the sim card without signing up then and there for a monthly plan. After some argument and consultation with others he recanted but insisted that he could not install the sim card without obtaining from me full personal identifying information (telephone number, e-mail address, home address).The next time I needed a sim card the Verizon store representative insisted she had to charge $10 for the card. She didn't require any personal information and she didn't make any effort to link the sim card with my iPad. She simply insisted on $10 for the sim card and handed it to me.It seems as if Verizon is using the expense and inconvenience of forced sim card inactivation in order to discourage a la carte usage of cell data and to encourage people to pay $20 or $30 dollars a month whether or not they need data service.Had I know about this policy I would never have purchased the Verizon iPad.  The Apple Store saleswoman who sold me the iPad was not aware of this flaw and did not advise me that it was an issue. Surprisingly, none of the Apple Store sales persons I have spoken to since then were aware of this issue.Unless you enjoy spending time at the Verizon Store or unless you intend to use a cellular data plan without interruption, you should stay away from the Verizon iPad.Update on February 4, 2013: I just left my local AT&T; store after speaking with the AT&T; store manager about this issue. He confirmed that AT&T; has adopted the Verizon policy and their new iPads also discourage a la carte usage by requiring the customer to purchase a new sim card if the customer cancels a la carte cell data service. It is clear that both major companies want to discourage at-will cell data usage and promote the more lucrative monthly subscription. What a shame and what a rip-off.  They will probably continue to do this until the customers rebel and refuse to purchase the higher priced iPad and/or the monthly cell data service plan.	
253	1	4	3	4	3	4	1	2	3	2	1	1	I HATE THIS SO MUCH. Okay, im a 13 year old girl. I have saved up all of my xmas money for an ipad, I am one of 4 kids, so we all pitched in to buy one for our family to share. The first thing i noticed was that the web browsing is hilarious. The magnifying glass is so retarted, i hate how it automatically corrects you. The camera is a joke, the apps are a million bucks, updates take a minimal of 3 hours, my imessages dissapear. The facetime is a pain to set up, my screen is green, i cant watch a video on it without it skipping, i dropped it (because my sister thought it would be oh so funny to drop a hot skillet on my foot, but my dropping it is not apples fault. They cant help it shattered) the app store is so stupid, the notes are plain, the email is sometimes not recieved, no flash player, you cant do home work on it, over all...... Go buy a new car and 4 other computers instead of this. The only reason its not gettin one star is because there is a crack over the first star.	
254	4	4	3	4	0	4	4	2	1	3	4	4	LOVE IT!!! This is my second Ipad ordered through Amazon..I bought one for myself which soon turned to being used more my husband than me...so i bought him one for himself. Now we are both happy! It was new in the box, package was exactly as stated. Thank you!	
255	4	2	4	4	0	4	1	2	3	4	4	4	so helpful. I want to start by saying I am not an apple fan boy. I am actually probably the antethesis of a fanboy. I am however convinced on the quality of their moble/tablet devices. That being said I love my Ipad. I have found it very helpful in school and work purposes. I have played around with other tablets and found the ios operating system to be far more intuitive and easy to use.	
256	4	4	2	3	4	0	3	2	3	1	4	4	Love it. I love the ipad! It is the best you can get buy it it is worth it ......... Nice nice	
257	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	1	1	4	4	Inpecable Experience. Is everything it is advertised for. It was a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with it. I am thinking of getting one for myself  but probably will wait to see what will have to offer the new 5th generation.The delivery service was inpecable so overall, it was a great experience. Thank you	
258	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	the best yet! This has to be the best I Pad yet.  I just love it.  It arrived quickly, was well packaged, and as described.	
259	4	4	4	4	4	1	3	0	4	0	2	4	Nice... too limited. Nice product but somewhat limited... was really lloking for a bridge product between my iphone and lap top..  it is nice and portable but lacking needed capabilities.	
260	3	1	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	Good. Very good, responsive and everything works fine, Can't go wrong with Apple! I'm actually using it to write this review c:	
261	4	3	4	4	4	4	2	1	3	4	3	3	I finally bought an iPad... I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Android phone when it was first introduced and had it for nearly 1.5 years. I have never been one of those "Apple Fans" and I really wanted to like the Android operating system. But I quickly found the Android OS to be a lot of hype and empty promises. Updating the Android OS is a nightmare, takes many months for hardware companies to release it (if they chose to support it) and I had to wipe my device each time (losing everything). The battery life was over-promised from the beginning and only got worse over time. As the tablet computers took off and became more popular, I wanted to buy an Android tablet but the reviews indicated the battery life was over-promised on most devices and the newer versions of OS were slow to be released and supported. I was tired of the empty promises and just wanted a device to work all day long and upgrade without losing everything. So I decided to give Apple a chance when they introduced the "New iPad" although I hated the name.	
262	4	4	2	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	Great gift idea. Got this for my son in college to replace Kindle Fire, laptop pc.He really likes this and is a very nice set up. Does everything hewants it to do.	
263	4	4	4	4	3	2	1	3	4	3	4	4	This is what tablet should be. I'm an user of IPad 2 and also use of that model and I need to say they do what tablets should do. It easy to use and designed having end-user in mind. Everything is simple and designed to let you focus on things you want to do. I also have a chance to use Android tablets as also Windows 8 tablets (in general I'm an Microsoft guy) and I need to say that IPad left other device far in behind.	
264	3	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	2	2	4	4	Product description is not correct. I recently purchased the newest "4th" gen iPad and it has literally changed my life. I had no idea just how much I would be using it. It's like having a smart phone for the for the first time all over again. I absolutely love it and am now considering one for my wife too.***description still says "newest version." However this is the 3rd gen iPad, and there is and has been a 4th gen out for several months. That is why this one is cheaper than the other one also advertised as the "newest model" or "newest version," so beware.***	
265	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	1	2	4	4	4	I finally took the plunge. After listening to several of my iPad owning friends rave about theirs I finally bit the bullet & bought one.  I am early on in the learning process but I have to admit that it was much easier to get up & running than any non-Apple technology product that I'd ever purchased.	
266	4	3	4	4	4	1	2	4	4	2	4	4	Bought this for my mom. Bought it for her birthday. I still have to help her with it because she is very challenged when it comes to electronics/technology hahaha. Quite funny. She loves all the ganes and apps she can get including even recipes and yoga poses and stuff like that. Easy access for the camera or video as well. Ipads are awesome. Just not the radiation like everything else that has it.	
267	0	0	4	4	3	1	2	1	1	4	3	4	Awesome Customer Service. I did have an issue with the IPad which I purchased "new" .  I found out from the EDealer that it was an open box used as a demo.  I expressed my disappointment to both the EDealer and Amazon.  It was taken care of quickly, effectively and too my liking.  I did have one more issue as the cable and wall charger did not work, it drained the battery instead of charging it...I purchased a new set for $26 and all is fine.  I will continue to do business with Amazon.  Their customer services excels over all other on line businesses I have dealt with.	
268	4	4	4	3	4	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	Love it. It is great, I use all the time, and the re are many apps that I can use in my classes, I just love it	
269	4	3	4	4	4	1	2	0	4	4	4	4	It is a big iphone. I liked a lot. The battery works well. It is a little bit heavy. Now I think I should have bought the small one. But the ipad is great for the ones used to itunes.	
270	4	3	4	4	4	1	2	4	4	4	4	4	Absolutely Awesome! I loved the iPad 3 Wifi version but I got to a point where I really depended on it more than my iPhone or than my computer when I wasn't in my house, so I decided to get the Cellular version. Wow it is just awesome. Now I get 4G LTE in my area and it is awesome I can be in the park or any where else and I can still use my iPad. I love it!	
271	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	4	0	3	4	4	I'm very happy with this device. It works good, is helpful  and i use it very often. I would choose it a second time. Thank you.	
272	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	4	4	4	Hearts desired fullfilled. Loving it�I recommend this produt to all, ordering is quick, fast and in a hurry. I give it give plus stars	
273	0	2	4	4	3	4	2	4	1	1	0	0	Ipad3 64gb w/4g, the sound stops working after 1.5 years daily use. I bought the Ipad3 w/4g when it released. I paid $900(including tax). After 1.5 years daily use, the sound stopped working. I took it to the apple store for genius bar. After 40mins inspection, the tech told me it is the hardware issues, if I want to replace the speaker, I have to pay $299.  They can't fix it in the store. Really? It is almost the cost to pay for a new ipad. Then he told me I can trade it in on the apple website, that would be the best solution. I never heard about this, then I asked him to show me where to find it on the apple website. He couldn't find it, and then he went to the back to ask someone. 5mins later, he returned to tell me there is no trade-in on the apple website. OK, this is the quality of an apple store tech. Of course my ipad is broken after the warranty expired, because it is not made to last. Apple can't wait to release a new ipad every year so that they can get money from your wallet. I thought their product was good quality. Not anymore, it doesn't last.	
274	4	3	4	4	4	1	1	4	2	4	3	4	Why my wife likes her iPad Gen3. Screen is much clearer and internet connection doesn't drop like my iPad 2nd gen. Unit does get much warmer than my gen 2.	
275	4	4	4	4	4	3	1	1	1	4	4	4	Love my iPad! Love, love, love my iPad!  I wanted an upgrade from my mini to the regular size and found this on Amazon Warehouse deals.  Plus, the fact that the 3rd Gen still has the larger a/c plug sealed the deal for me.  Great product and the retina is absolutely amazing!	
276	4	2	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	A great deal. Who don't love the ipad? This was a great price. I like everything about the company because they went out of their way to make sure everything was okay with the sale. I would pay anything from this company again without question, I would recommend this product and company. To anyone who is looking for a great deal.	
277	3	3	4	4	3	4	3	1	4	3	3	4	Happy with iPad. This is our first iPad. The new Air is 3 or 4 hundred dollars more than this one was. I think this one is very good buy for the money.	
278	4	3	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	3	4	4	I really, really love it!!! I couldn't believe how easy it is to operate. The screen is so clear, and the apps are easy to download. I would recommend it to everyone. I would like to upgrade to a ipad air.	
279	2	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	1	4	0	4	Mistake Purchase. This was a terrible purchase.  Very bizarre from the beginning and it was returned.  Advertised as a NEW iPad; arrived in a refurbished type of packaging with NO paperwork.  I expected it to be NEW in an Apple box with all accompanying paperwork.	
280	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	0	4	4	Love it. Addicted to my ipad. It goes everywhere I go. I don't even use my computer any more. The ipad is so easy to use. Tried using an android and hated it.	
281	4	3	4	4	4	1	3	2	4	3	4	4	Best iPad value right now. The retina display is genius! It's the most significant improvement to any iPad, and separates the 3 from the 2 more than any other release. I read exclusively on electronic devices, so I'd been thinking about upgrading to the retina display for a long time. I finally sold my 32gb iPad 2 to buy a "Used-Very Good" 16gb iPad 3 for a $21 net cash outlay. At about $300 the "Used-Very Good" iPad 3 is the best iPad value out there right now. (As of this writing its 2 models away from the current iPad Air)	
282	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	Love it!!! This was my first time ever using an Apple product but I absolutely love it. Easy to work with. Great product! Great seller!	
283	4	3	4	4	4	1	2	4	4	3	3	4	The only option for aviation apps. I bought my iPad 3 for using aviation apps in my airplane. The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.	
284	4	0	4	3	4	4	0	4	1	4	4	4	Arrived very quickly, product as expected. Very nice. Arrived very quickly.  I have no doubt it works fine. I have to purchase a cellular contract at my present location prior to set up, but works as expected, prior to set up.	
285	3	4	4	4	4	1	2	4	4	3	4	4	Love at first sight! This is the first iPad I have owned, and was skeptical about spending so much money. I had tried out other people's iPads, and was really happy with how they ran, and thought it was much better than any android tablet on the market. Long story short, I got a great deal on the iPad, and went for it. First impressions were, well, love at first sight. The iPad has a great hd retina screen, which offers a very eye pleasing viewing experience. Boot time was very fast, and setup took less than 2 minutes. I am very happy with the options that come bundled wth the iPad, such as find my iPad, iTunes, and iCloud. Apple support has been fantastic as well. One call or email has been enough to answer all of my questions. Overall, the value of this iPad can not be found in any other tablet on the market. If you are thinking about the iPad, read the features, and all of the positive reviews. I promise you will not be disappointed with your iPad.	
286	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	4	2	4	4	so fast. this has siri and better cameras ,i love this ,its so fast , its better than the 4, paws up	
287	4	3	3	3	4	1	2	1	2	1	4	4	The best 9.7 inch tablet I have ever used! What's included?The device is packaged nicely and the box includes the iPad charger rated at 2.1 Amps at 5.1 VDC. It also includes a USB to iPad cable for use with the power supply and it also interfaces with your computer to connect to iTunes. The cable is only 41 inches long which is always one of my pet peeves because when you plug the charger in the wall the cable is too short to allow you to reach to the top of a dresser for example and charge the product at night. The first thing you will do is buy a USB male to female extender cable or buy the Apple extended version charger at $29 cost to charge the unit properly.You also get a one page instruction card that basically says to turn on the unit and follow the directions. You also get the important product information guide and two white apple logos to use as you desire.Set up* Turn it on and select your language and touch next.* Select your country and touch next.* It will ask you if you want to have the unit identify the location of where you are at. Select yes as this is important for later tracking of the device if it is stolen.* Activate networks, which in my case was only WIFI. Select your SSID from the list of possible connections, enter in your password, if your network is protected. Touch next.* Activate your Apple ID using your e-mail address and your Apple password.* Accept the Apple terms.* It will then start a set up.* It asks if you want to use the cloud option for communication and uploading and downloading.* It asks if you want to use the dictation mode when you touch the microphone on the keyboard.* The iPad then does some diagnostics and loading.* It asks you if you are ready to register the product with Apple.* It then tells you that you are ready to use the iPad.Attach the unit to your computer that has iTunes installed, (make sure you are using the latest version):* When you plug in the iPad it asks if you want to set it up as a new iPad or to use the data of an existing iPad. I selected New iPad.* It asks you to select an iPad name. Make sure that it is unique so that you don't confuse iTunes into thinking you have two devices with the same name.* The iPad is set to auto sync and I stopped that as my music files are to large for the 64 GIG memory. I select only the music, videos, and photos I want to sync.* The unit will begin to sync your data and it will install all of your existing apps you own as long as you have not exceeded the limit of 5 Apple devices using those apps.* Your apps are all loaded as single apps and if you want you have to combine them into folders and name the folders. This took me about an hour as we own over 200 apps. The list was 10 pages long.* I then told the iPad to sync with my contacts, calendar and with two email accounts using Outlook. Don't forget you will have to enter in your ISP email account password for each email account you sync with before your e-mail will be down loaded.* All of these steps occurred without error and they happened very quickly. This unit is faster than the iPad 2 device and it clearly shows while processing these steps.Installing Kindle Reader app.* I use the Kindle reader app a lot and it was already installed above by the app installation process.* Touch the Kindle app and it will ask you for your Amazon ID and password. Almost instantly it tells you that you can look at your books in the Cloud and you will start to load up the book covers. Each cover will have a downward pointing arrow on it to indicate that it has not been downloaded to your device.* Touch each cover and the book will download. I have a very good WIFI and each book only took seconds. I own about 350 Kindle books and the process was very fast. You can touch 10 to 15 books and it will download them sequentially and very quickly.* When you are reading a book and want to look up a word in the dictionary, the first time it will ask you if you want to download the dictionary to your device. Select yes and it takes about 5 seconds to do this. Look up of words is virtually instantaneous.* You will notice the outstanding quality of the display as the text looks like a printed page with perfect resolution and dark text. It is impressive!Find iPhone* Touch the Find iPhone icon* Enter in your Apple ID and Password and touch Go.* The application will then locate all of your Apple devices assigned to your account. You can now look at each location either on a map or even a satellite view. If your iPad does not show up then go to settings and touch Location Services and turn on Find My iPad and Status Bar Icon. You will be able to locate your device within about 10 to 20 feet!* It is critical that you set this up as you can now track your device if it is lost or stolen!* You can also make the missing device, Play a Sound, Remote Lock, Remote Wipe, and even allow it to send you an e-mail when the device is found.SecurityThis is one of Apple's shining stars regarding security. By touching settings for example you can set Auto-Lock to on, select a Passcode Lock and set restrictions. By doing this you can lock your iPad with a simple or more complex passcode (recommended) so that if it is stolen you will not lose your data to a hacker. Under restrictions the list is 21 items long. You can give this device to a child and turn off the web browsing, social networks, buying games and products, dictation, installing and deleting apps, etc...This product is professionally designed and if you are giving this to a child (or even giving them an iPod) you can lock these features and feel secure that they have access to only the things you want them to have. You can even assign age limits for music, shows, movies, apps, etc.. It is the best security setup available today.Web browsingUnbelievably fast! This is where the strength of the new processor shows and the speed of the WIFI connection is wonderful. It is virtually as fast as my 1GHz wired Ethernet connected computer. The streaming of video is fast and flawless.Face TimeThe advantage of having a front and rear facing camera is that you can call anyone using a iPhone 4 or iPad 2 or the new iPad and talk to them and see them simultaneously if they are connected to a good WIFI connection. The new cameras on this iPad are 5 Mega pixels and you will see the difference immediately. The video and picture are extremely clear.Face Time is very nice and if you want you can even swap camera front to back so instead of the person you called seeing you they can see what you are seeing. This is a very nice and powerful feature.TypingTyping is smooth and fast. You cannot type with two thumbs (as the screen is too wide) and it is better to rotate the device to landscape mode and get a good sized keyboard to type on. I can almost type as fast on the iPad as I can on a full size computer keyboard.E-mailThis set up immediately and downloaded 50 e-mails into each account in about a minute. The e-mail system is easy to use and to respond on. It set up two email accounts for me in about 1 minute to set up and 1 minute to download the 50 e-mails.AppsApple has the best app store in the market. Amazon is getting better but Apple has a head start. Literally, "There is an app for that!" is not a joke but a reality. All of my 200 apps loaded via iTunes in about 20 minutes and we have a lot of them.CameraThe new 5 Megapixel camera is very nice. The quality is instantly recognizable in every photo and video you take. You actually record video in 1080P HD quality and between the camera and the display you will be amazed at how good the result is.There is no flash on the camera so that is an issue in low lighting.One of the advantages of the iPad is the number of high quality apps that can be used to tweak your photographs and make them look professional. We own several of these apps and the results can be spectacular. You can literally make a professional looking photography show using these apps and with this improved camera the results will even be better.Dictation and microphoneUsing the iPad Notes function you can touch the microphone on the keyboard and dictate to the iPad. I dictated this paragraph and it translated it to text with fewer typing errors than I did while typing this section. After you finish dictation, just retouch the microphone on the keypad and the voice recording will be converted to text.FacebookSet up of Facebook was fast and easy. Just enter your e-mail address and then your Facebook Password and you are on line. The quality of the pictures looks much better on the display as long as the person who set them up used a high quality photo.iTunes music and moviesI have input every CD and audio book I own into iTunes. I also have loaded MP4 movies into iTunes and they can be played on the iPad with very good results. They literally are HD quality. I purchased a 64 GIG version white iPad 3 to have the space to load as much music, photos, and videos as I can onto the device and use it for an entertainment center. I loaded 200 apps at 9.5 GIG and 350 Kindle books and I still have almost 48 GIG of free memory left for my other items!GamingI won't spend a lot of time here but just to say that we all know that the Apple products have some of the best gaming apps available. They vary from action games, sports games, strategy games, puzzle games and tower defense style games. Make sure that you buy the HD version of the games for the iPad in order to take advantage of the new display features.DisplayThe 9.7 Retina Display; 2048 x 1536 resolution produces razor sharp pictures and text. You simply have to see it to believe it. This screen has 3.1 million Pixels and is powered by a quad core graphics chip. The first three things I noticed were the quality of the pictures and videos and the text is crisper and darker.BatteryThis design has up to 10 hours of battery life even with all of these features. This makes the Apple iPad a truly enjoyable device when you know that you can listen to music, read, watch videos and work on photos for 10 hours and not have to worry about recharging or being tied to a power cable.Cons* No flash on the camera.* No 7" tablet available for a lower price and portability.* Power and connection cable 41" long, way too short in my opinion.* High price, demanded by the quality but still a gulp when you buy one!	
288	4	4	3	4	3	1	3	0	3	4	4	4	Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead? UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are "post-paid" and "pre-paid."  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can "suspend" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.	
289	3	4	4	0	1	1	1	2	4	2	3	3	iPad from an Android Perspective. After reading a lot of hype and reviews about the new iPad, I thought I would give it a try, despite the fact that I have been using and mostly enjoying the Asus TFT101 (Transformer) for about a year now. Some quick pros and cons:PROS vs Android/Asus:*Retina Display: The screen is very good, but coming from the Asus, which has a higher resolution than the iPad 2, I was not blown away by it. It feels like a larger version of the Retina display on the iPod Touch, a device which I also use frequently. Coming from these two quality screens, the new iPad display was not a massive step up in quality, but I suspect many people who have been using different devices will be pleasantly surprised. Where this display shines is in color saturation and text quality. Images pop off of the screen and reading is the best I have seen on any handheld device.*App Selection: Many have made this point, but it is worth mentioning again. The App selection on iPad blows Android out of the water. There really is no comparison here. Even the free apps seem to be of higher quality than on Android.* UI: The smoothness of the UI on the iPad is second to none. The screen registers every swipe and gesture, and pages flip seamlessly and with high quality animation. The ASUS Transformer features the much discussed 2 second "Android lag," which is not a deal breaker, but feels less sophisticated compared to the iPad (although this seems less of an issue in ICS).s* Build Quality: The solidity of the iPad is a major plus compared to the Transformer. The iPad is heavy, solid, and the tactile transition from glass to brushed metal is appealing and borderline luxurious. The Asus simply feels like a sheet of plastic (which it is). The Asus also suffers from noticeable light bleeding, the charger also died within a year and the keyboard dock had to be RMA'd and repaired. I don't think these things will be an issue with the iPad.CONS vs Android/Asus:* OS: I may be in the minority here, but I find Android to be a more feature rich and deep OS. I like having some degree of control over my devices, and I appreciate the fact that Android lets me get "under the hood" a bit more than iOS. It doesn't trap me within a proprietary "ecosystem" of content, it allows me to use the device as an external hard drive to transfer media, and I can expand the storage via MicroUSB as I see fit (This has been beaten to death, but Apple really needs to allow users to expand storage-even on a proprietary basis). And there are also little touches that I think are well done, such as Android's ability to run many programs at once and allow the user to flip through them- a feature that I miss in iOS.  Its Gmail widget is an invaluable and quick way to check email, and its placement of the back button is far superior to iOS. This last point may seem minor, but the Android back button at the bottom of the screen is more convenient as you do not have to remove your hands from the device to go back to a previous screen.*Weight: I prefer a heavier device but I know this is an issue for some people. The iPad is noticeably heavier than the Transformer (but lighter than other Android tablets, such as the Acer Iconia).*Keyboard Dock: This is a wonderful, albeit expensive, add-on for the Asus Transformer. The keyboard dock/charger is incredibly useful as it extends battery life, expands storage, and enhances usability. I know that you can use Apple's bluetooth mouse and keyboard with the iPad, but the all-in-one solution from Asus is more appealing as it basically affords you the convenience of a netbook and a tablet. I suspect this will be the future of mobile computing. As I noted above, however, my keyboard was defective out of the box and reviews suggest that the build quality of these units is quite poor.OVERALL: If you are new to tablets and want the best UI and great ease of use, go for the iPad. If you are technically inclined and want more control over your device, go with a high-end Android tablet. The iPad has the best tablet hardware on the market, but Android as an OS is closing the gap.  That having been said, Apple's iPad, while not revolutionizing the act of computing, is instead changing how we consume the internet, and the newest iteration of the iPad is the most convincing example of this vision.**UPDATE**I just wanted to confirm that I too have experienced the extremely long recharge times reported various internet outlets (about 5 and a half hours in my case). It by no means detracts from my enjoyment of the product, but planning recharges and making sure to top off the charge at appropriate times does reduce the device's mobility.	
290	4	3	4	3	3	4	4	1	0	0	4	4	Good for Reading. I didn't buy the first and second generation iPads because I didn't like the resolution. I opted for the Kindle DX instead which is more suitable for reading. But the newest generation iPad has a better resolution and smoothness of text compared to the first and second generation iPads and it's much better than the Kindle DX reading device. The only issue is the screen glaring which is not comfortable if sitting nearby the light source.IMHO it's worth to upgrade from iPad two if you read a lot of text and watch HD videos on netflix. For other uses like occasional browsing, reading emails and gaming: The iPad 2 is a good option for a lower price.	
291	4	4	4	3	4	1	1	2	3	2	4	4	First Tablet... Amazing!! I never have had a tablet before. I decided I was going to get one for school and I'm a freshman in college. Overall, completely satisfied with my purchase. I wasn't one hundred percent sure between this or the iPad 2 and I think I made the right decision. I would definitely recommend the 32 gigabyte model because you'll need the space with the HD apps. Although I've never owned another tablet I feel like this is the best one out there right now. I recommend this to any person thinking of getting a tablet for the first time.Pros:Awesome screenFastGreat app storeAwesome gamesPerfect for taking notesCons:Not as customizable as AndroidIf you're taking notes for college, I would suggest a stylus for handwritten notes.	
292	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	1	4	4	Not Just a Toy to Play Games Can Be a Laptop Substitute. I waited a long time before purchasing an  IPad and I am happy that I finally did.  The new one is fast and has a great screen especially when watching a video.  So far I have avoided putting games on it, because I want to try using it for productive purposes.  The new IPad is not too heavy and does not get too hot.  Overall I am very satisfied with my IPad and had no problems purchasing it through an Amazon seller.	
293	1	3	4	3	0	1	1	4	2	2	1	3	Limited functions compared to even a cheap laptop running Windows. I tried two Android based tablets (Galaxy Tab and Acer A500) and sent them both back for one problem or another.  The Acer was the worst.  At the urging of my Apple fanboy brother I bought an iPad.With the iPad, get ready to spend money to make the thing work like Windows 2.0.  Using iTunes to move files from my PC to the iPad is like using some clunky shareware program from 1998.  Apple hates Windows so much they torture Windows users with the iTunes program.Tablets, Apple or Android, are limited computers that substitute slick and snazzy graphics on a super nice screen for actual wide functionality and reconfigurability, essentially they are smart phones with a bigger screen and no phone.I really think people like the iPad because of it's slick design, clever graphics, and compact size, and so make excuses for all it's functional limitations.  For me the vaunted iPad and Apple iOS is a huge disappointment and offers less than Android which itself isn't that great.I'll probably send this back and try another Android tablet because I miss having an SD card slot, proper USB port, and simple access to files on my PC.	
294	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	Awesome iPad 3 Tablet. Absolutely loved and adored with many different types of programs and applications.  It is a very wonderful gift that I have received.  It has a wonderful amount of applications that can be used daily in my career field and also to be used at home in many different ways.	
295	4	3	3	4	4	1	3	3	2	4	4	4	Perfect! I love my iPad! I've had it for almost two weeks and have used it for multiple things. I also bought myself a Logitech folio with built-in keyboard, so it makes the whole experience all the more productive and fun.The iPad is extremely responsive, it has a beautiful sharp screen that makes movie and picture viewing a delight. The tools that come with the tablet are convenient and easy to use. If you've used Apple products before, familiarizing yourself with the iPad is a breeze. But even my husband, who's not an Apple veteran, could figure it out pretty quickly :)	
296	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	0	1	3	4	A great device to get. This was a gift for myself since im out here on deployment but this is a great tool for me and i enjoy it for the apps and i mostly gotten it for was the fact that it has a front facing camera so when i use video calling apps such as Skype it works great. i also gotten the snugg fit case for it too and i like how it covers it up when not in use. some nifty lil features that you can do is when you lock the screen you can do a slide show of pictures that you have. the camera take some excellent photos that was better than what i was expecting. Another reason why i bought this was because im with verizion wireless and this is also a replacement for a tablet that was stolen from me, and it was cheaper for me to buy off of here and then get it activated. Cant get any apps for right now due to internet but overall i would recommend this for the time being and its a great device.	
297	0	3	4	3	1	1	1	4	2	1	0	4	Crapple's latest "innovation" My mother got one of these for her teaching job. Being an Android fan, I looked at it. I was not impressed because:(1) Its almost the same exact thing as the iPad 2. (Ooh Retina display! Great.)(2) It runs iOs, not Android. Enough said.(3) Not much different from other tablets. (And the iPad was NOT the first tablet.)Though their are some pros:(1) Makes a GREAT paperweight! I can not tell you how many papers this thing could hold down!(2) Efficient weapon. The screen breaks so easily that if you are under attack, grab the nearest iPad (check the trash cans, you will find one within your first few tries) break the screen, and defend yourself with the glass!	
298	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Wonderful IF ONLY....... There were no instructions on how to  register all the different components.  I still cannot get into most of the apps.  Honestly, I am totally frusttrated with this device.  I know it can do so many things, yet, I cannot get to any of them.  So far I have been able to get emails (sometimes), take pictures, take videos, and send pictures.  Other than that,  it just sits and gathers dust.  NOT what I expected for $700.	
299	4	4	4	3	4	1	3	1	1	2	4	4	iPad review. My purchase of the new iPad 3rd generation  from amazon was perfect and exactly as the description said. It works great and I love it. I haven't had any issues with it and when i received it, it was flawless and brand new and i was extremely happy about that. If you're looking to buy an iPad choose amazon to purchase it from. I was fully satisfied with my purchase of the new iPad from amazon.

307	4	3	0	4	4	1	3	4	4	2	4	4	Great gadget. This is my first tablet and boy I'm glad I got an iPad and all the apps for allmost everything its great	
308	1	4	3	3	1	1	4	4	4	4	1	4	It's more fun to look at or read about than to actually use it. I never had another tablet, so can't compare - this is strictly "1st time user experience".Also, I never used Apple's products (have a long UNIX/DOS/Windows history, though), so some of the disappointment is probably caused by general Apple policies/approaches, not by this particylar iPad...So, the one good thing I can say: the graphics look good - good resolution, good colors, etc.Plus, the camera works not too bad - but only for static or very slowly moving objects; also needs good lighting - in bad lighting the image gets very grainy (but that's not a professional camera, after all...)The rest I like much less... - It's rather heavy for its size, so holding it 'casually' is out of question: you have to hold it with one hand (using the other to operate the screen), you can't put you fingers around opposit edges like you'd do with a smaller phone; so you have to balance it horizontally on your palm with spread fingers - good if you have big hands and long fingers, otherwise just go to the nearest table... If you want to use it at an angle (e.g., while sitting in an armchair or lying on a sofa) - you still can kind of prop it on one hand (e.g., bottom edge on your palm and a few fingers behind it for a prop) - but your hand will start getting numb in just a few minutes (remember the weight!!!)- Sound: given its size, I didn't really expect it to have Bose quality, but still, it's rather more rattling than I care to listen to music with...- Battery: it never really gave "...Up to 10 Hours of Battery Life...", and with time it dies faster, and takes longer to recharge - now it only takes it ~2 hours to go from 100% to 8% (and it's been less than a month!!!)- Cord: power cord is extremely short (never seen something similar in my life!!!), so, if you want to use it while plugged in (remember the battery life?) you need an extension cord - with the bulgy adapter dangling just below your knees (when standing - figure out where it'll be when you're sitting or lying down) - It might be not a bad idea for a new product: "belt clip for the iPad's extension cord"...- I resent the idea of 'sandboxes' for applications, where each application can see only its own data and nothing else: e.g., if I have two applications capable of viewing PDF files, and I download/save a PDF with one application, I can't open it with the other; or if you have two 'file managers', each one's storage will be separate, so you have to remember which files are managed with which manager... And if you try to install a 'better file manager', moving your files from the old one is a nightmare (if you figure how at all)... Honestly, 'Jailbreak' seems almost a must... :-(- Applications: yes, applications are provided by different vendors; but there are some that come preinstalled - and some of them suck big time... (e.g., Safari, the web browser, etc. - but that's a separate big topic...)P.S. One thing I forgot to mention - if kept 'On' for > 1 hour, it heats quite noticeably; at 2+ hours it can be almost burning the holding hand...	
309	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	1	3	4	4	4	Very Good Service and Product. It is very good product and also the service is very good. Overall  I am very happy or satisfied. I would recommend this strongly.

311	1	4	0	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	Returned to Electrobrands. Item was determined to be an old version and no longer needed, therefore I contacted the shipper and returned it.	
312	4	4	4	3	3	1	0	1	4	1	3	3	I Love It But...... I think this was my fault but my only complaints are shortcomings I never considered when I bought my iPad. I never realized this "model" iPad would be incapable of using anything but wi-fi. I was under the impression, like the iPhones, there would be an option to get a broadband plan for those times when wi-fi isn't available. Unfortunately, I didn't learn this until a few weeks later. My other issue is that the iPad cannot text or IM to any non-Apple device. You can email, just not text. With this issue however, there are apps you can get which will allow for texting to other devices. They aren't quite as simple to use(just a few more steps) but I'm sure that is by design. So do your research better than I did, especially if you want to take your iPad with you and need the option of buying a plan for it.	
313	3	2	2	3	4	2	1	0	4	3	4	4	Great deal for a 349.99 price for the 32gb black. Smooth, perfect and high quality nothing more :).Bought a refurnished one, and its in great shape for a cheaper price.Exceded my expectations.	
314	3	4	4	3	4	4	1	2	1	1	4	4	A must have for work. I love this! I struggled with buying an Ipad or android device. I discovered that the iPad is far more versatile for my work applications so that is what I purchased. I have no regrets because it is great all on its own. I should have known since my iPod classic runs a very close second as my favorite electronic device!	
315	3	4	4	4	3	0	1	4	4	3	4	4	Super satisfied. Excelent choice and awesome item, I recomend you get this item for you or for a gift; u will be 100% satisfied	
316	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	0	3	4	4	4	On time - on budget. Everything came to us with no surprises.  Product was as advertised/described and arrived on time.  As far as the iPad itself we are enjoying the snot out of it!  My wife and I are gymnastics coaches and the Coaches' Eye app is absolutely worth every cent, we use it ALOT.	
317	3	4	4	3	4	3	4	0	0	4	3	4	Loved it. I loved this device accroding to all the feature its simply gr8..Camera is simply gives gr8 output features as well as the front camera gives best resoultion for chating	
318	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	4	4	Bomb dot com! How much do I love my iPad? Let me count the endless ways. Besides being just about the coolest electronic gadget I've ever had, it completely replaced my dead laptop & then some. I can check email, update Facebook, surf the web take pictures, read books, check reservations/bank balances/weather/news, & watch movies. Damn this thing is my most treasured e-tool!!! Why live without it, what's the point?	
319	3	4	3	4	0	0	1	4	1	2	3	4	Definitely a premium product for a premium price. I received my refurbished iPad 3rd generation from Web Marketing Direct for $330. It was definitely a good deal, considering the device had minimal damage and a newly replaced screen. I was set on getting the 3rd generation since it included the Retina Display without having the infamous lightning dock connector found on the newer iPad. All in all, I was very pleased with the item I received, now on to the actual device:Screen:I didn't believe all the hype at first about the Retina display, but in fact it is all true. The display is definitely stunning and features probably the best screen on any tablet, although I think the Google Nexus 10 still wins in terms of pure sharpness.Build:As stated in the review's title, you can definitely feel the premium material that was used to put this device together. I wouldn't go so far as to call it durable though, which is why I recommend you get a case and screen protector.OS:Here is where the iPad falls short. At least for now, Apple's iOS 6 is the iPad's most visible weakness. It looks and feels stale, despite the iPad's beautiful screen. The static icons just don't cut it anymore, especially if you have used Android 4.0 or above on a tablet. Hopefully iOS 7 will improve upon the software, but from the initial previews it seems to be more or less the same.Battery Life:This is where the iPad excels most notably. The 10 hour reported battery life proves to be all but true, even with the brightness and high levels. The fact that iOS is extremely simple with little to no graphical animations is what optimizes the iPad's great battery life.Productivity:I know that most people buy tablets for recreational use, but sometimes people choose to integrate it with their work life through e-mail and word processing. Unfortunately, the iPad isn't really great for either, considering that the keyboard accessories from most manufacturers are overpriced and Apple's own iWork suite is far too minimal at a high price. Also, true multitasking with multi-window support is just not present and further shows iOS' limitations.Overall, the Apple iPad is a great device for media consumption while delivering excellent battery life. If you are not able to fork up the heavy price, there are definitely cheaper options available such as the Google Nexus 10 but they arguably don't offer the same 'premium' look and feel as the iPad does.	
320	4	4	0	3	4	1	4	3	0	4	4	4	Great product. I enjoy using the iPad 3 it is a wonderful as is efficient to use.  Also, it is portable and reliable.	
321	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	never without it. quick compact I take it everywhere visuals are great and I can talk on Skype giving me AUDIO and VISIUAL as I talk.I can store information like tickets for flights receipts for products codes for accounts appointments take pictures videos musicgrocery list and more you decide.	
322	4	0	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	3	Very nice used product. Very good shape, works great and connects wifi very easily and quickly. This item does however charge very slowly weather it's plugged into USB or wall charger. I don't know if that is the nature of this beast or not as my son'd is the next gen up from this and his charges rather quickly. Overall, very good product, very good packaging and very good seller.	
323	0	3	4	2	4	0	1	4	1	4	0	0	THIS SUCKS. I BOUGHT THIS ITEM THREE DAYS AGO AND I RECIVED IT TODAY. I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING A GOOD PRODUCT, IT WAS SAVERLEY SCRATCHED ON THE SCREEN, THE SIDES AND BACK WERE FULL OF DINTS AND NO BOOK FOR IT OR CHARGER. I  WILL NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.	
324	2	3	0	3	4	1	2	4	4	0	2	2	OK. Came a little later than the expected delivery dates, but that wasn't too much of a problem. I bought it refurbished and while the screen is pretty clear of blemishes, the same cannot be said for the rest of the exterior. There were scratches and signs of previous usage on the back and the corners. Did not come with the wall charger either but it did have the cable. All in all, it's in OK condition but it works and does its job.	
325	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Omg who doesn't. We all love our iPads I also enjoyed the discount amazon had off the apple store. Worth it when you know how to work apple products already. I wish I bought the 3 g model though it was the same price a few weeks later. Still loving it though.	
326	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	2	1	3	4	4	IPAD 3G. Love it already!!! The quality is superb! I can't wait to use it for my studying! Love the black outline.	
327	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	Great tablet. Got this for a really good price and with minimal damage. Works great and I can use it for both work and play. Takes a little getting used to how to use it, but I'm enjoying it a lot	
328	4	4	4	4	1	4	3	3	4	0	4	4	Hearts desired fullfilled. Loving it�I recommend this produt to all, ordering is quick, fast and in a hurry. I give it give plus stars	
329	2	2	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	1	3	3	Met most expectations. It works just like any I Pad. I have no complaints. It came with passwords on it that we had a bit of a problem  However, when the sellar was notified. It took care of the problem immediately. I would recommend this sellar to others. I was a bit disappointed that the password were not removed prior to shipping that is why I rated the sellar at a 4 rather than a five.	
330	4	1	4	4	4	2	4	4	3	4	3	3	Like it very convenient for travel. Love it but cord included very very short...battery life so so but it was used.....okay for what I pd....satisfied for my first tablet	
331	4	4	3	4	4	1	4	1	2	2	4	4	Apple iPad 3rd generation. Love it-- one of the best purchases that I've ever made.  I've had no regrets even with never versions of the iPad being released.  Mine was the last version that used the 30 pt connector instead of the lightning connector.  Use it every day for email, apps, web surfing and connecting to a Google Drive.	
332	0	3	1	3	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	Finally, my own portable "computer" I don't want or need a smart phone, but this does the trick for me. If I want what it offers, all I do is open the case; if I don't,, I just leave it closed. Unlike the phone, it is only available on my terms.	
333	4	0	4	4	4	4	1	3	4	1	4	4	great size. Great size for carrying especially if you have back problems and/or a disability like me.  Worthwhile upgrade from my iPad 1.  Great screen and I use it organize myself everyday.	
334	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	Wasn't going to upgrade but... This will be short since I'm typing on an iPad. If you read or are planning on reading on your iPad, the new iPad is the only way to go. I had no idea the old screen was straining my eyes until I used the new one. I can read much more now without feeling like my eyes are tired. Magazines are amazing to look at. I feel like the jump from gen 2 to 3 has been bigger than 1 to 2. The display is that much of a difference.	
335	4	3	4	3	4	0	4	0	0	2	4	4	A very good purchase. as a first time tablet user, I am simply blown away by the new stunning ipad. The screen is simply gorgeous and the clarity and crispness of the text is literally like reading a paper in hand. Can't really describe it as you have to see it to believe it. I feel like I can touch the text itself instead of reading them through a screen. If you use ipad as a book reader, I highly recommend you to get it. The text quality do improve a whole lot. But I think regular gallery pictures and videos will look the same in your regular non-retina devices.I couldn't seem to find too many retina-ipad3 specific apps out there in the wild that I am interested in. I am not a big gamer so I will have to wait to see how other productivity apps will look in this stunning new screen. Flipboard and Pulse do look absolutely amazing and the browsing experience is even more elevated here.After lots of research, I believe the only sure smartcover for ipad that is guaranteed to work is the Apple Smartcover. So I purchased one with it and so far happy with my decision. I did get some minor scratches on the back already so I am rushing to get a Smartcover partner to protect the backcase. I am the kind of guy who aren't usually careful with gadgets but this ipad just have the magic draw to get pamper.Can't comment too much on the battery life, but it still hasn't drained out after days of playing. So it looks good! Wish there is a wireless wifi charger for this baby like the rumored Samsung S3 has. then it would be perfect! Since ipad does not have any usb ports, it comes along with a wall charger. But I didn't find it as a hindrance at all given its long battery life. My overall interaction with my new ipad is an absolute joy as everything is so easy to use and very intuitive. Kudos to Apple for making such a gorgeous, simple and clean, and absolutely intuitive product.Before settling on the new ipad, I have been debating whether to go for android tablet or not. I am a very happy android smartphone user so is not allergic to the android ecosystem. But the android tablet world is a different beast. Most of the android apps seem to tailor more to the smartphone so won't look as good on the tablet. Hard to find Android 4.0 Ice-cream sandwich even on the latest android tablets so the current bunch look dated. Granted there are a lot more hardware options to choose from and specs maybe more powerful, but none match the quality, ease of use and overall look and feel of ipad. The other factor that seal the deal for me is that the resale value of ipad is so overwhelming strong that I can safely buy it now and upgrade it later in the future, knowing that my current device will still fetch a pretty penny.For would be first-time tablet/ipad users, I highly recommend going for it. It is going to be a wonderful experience that you have to own it to believe it. Given the high resale value of the currently existing ipad2 and how the new ipad costs pretty much the same as before, upgrading it is not a bad idea at all. For those people on the fence about getting an ipad or android tablets either existing, or the upcoming Samsung Note or tab tablet, or even the highly anticipated Asus transformer infinity, you own it to yourself to give the new ipad a try.	
336	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	0	4	4	A wonderful Tablet and great Apple Quality. I pre-ordered the 3rd Generation Apple iPad after being a relatively early adopter of the original iPad.  I loved the original iPad and have used it for productivity and fun.I decided to wait for the 3rd generation iPad and am glad I did.  It sports a 5 megapixal camera and video camera capability with the beautiful retina display (which I have on my iPhone 4).  The design and curves are the same as the 2nd generation iPad, so iPad 2 cases should fit this iPad without a hitch.  I purchased the rooCASE Convertible Premium Leather (Red) Case Cover with 24 Angle Adjustable Stand for Apple iPad 2 / iPad 3 / The new iPad and it's been a nice protector although I am a fan of the Otterbox iPad 2 Defender Case - Black.Overall, if you are a fan of iPad (or Apple in general) and have the iPad first Generation, you will notice a nice change.  If you have the iPad 2 and were thinking of upgrading to the latest model ... you may want to just hold off.  The differences are in the chip and the camera quality and display.  Depending on how you use your iPad (power user like me or casual user), that will help you to judge.I think the switch from first Generation to third Generation iPad is definitely a great and worthy leap.  I would question the switch from 2nd Gen to 3rd Gen if you are just a casual user.  Truth is, from the outside ... you won't really know the difference.  In this case, it's the guts that make all the difference.I love it!  5 stars.	
337	0	0	4	3	4	1	4	1	4	2	0	0	A useless product you will never use, overpriced by Amazon. Everybody who I've spoken to who bought an ipad complains that they barely even used them. I bought this one and after two hours on it realized it's a waste of money. First I browsed all the apps in the store to see how this can benefit my life, and it didn't in any way.All the products were immature as if they were meant for 7-year olds. There is nothing of use here for an adult in the professional world. It's a kids toy, or meant for people who don't have many responsibilities, to feel like they do.On another note, this product only costs $499 in stores, Amazon is attempting to charge over $50 higher here, so if you must have it even though I guarantee you will never use it, don't get ripped off by Amazon.	
338	4	4	3	0	4	1	0	4	4	0	2	3	Great product but Capacity is not 16GB. I purchased this new model for my wife here through AMAZON.  Delivery was quick and unit was delivered new.  So far she enjoys it a lot. She enjoys her streaming videos everywhere around the house.  Picture quality is great.  Response is better than her old laptop.  I would give this product 5 starts but find one big issue with it.I purchased a model that is sold as 16GB and yet it says capacity is only 13GB when we view it on I-tunes.  1GB less might be Ok but missing 3GB is a bit too much.  I will be calling Apple to see if there is some defect with this unit.  My old I-Pod was listed as 8GB and showed 8GB of total storage. The price for these units jumps a lot for every few GB's so feel a bit cheated with the loss of 3GBs.Second reason for only three stars is that these units don't charge with the USB connection to our normal desktop computers.  You have to use the AC adapter to charge it.  This might be due to the current required to charge these larger batteries so make sure you have an extra AC Adapter if you travel.	
339	4	2	4	0	3	3	2	4	4	0	4	4	Couldn't wait to get it. Was glad when it arrived!  Shipper requires a signature and new rules by the Post Ofc caused a delay of three days for me.  P.S. download the user guide of the website, cuz nothing as in paperwork comes with it.	
340	3	4	3	4	3	2	4	4	4	4	3	4	I-pad 3. Got it for my wife, she loves it see her playing with it all the time!!! dont know much about it myself but as long as she is happy, you know the rest!	
341	4	3	4	4	4	1	4	0	0	1	4	4	Awesome retina display. One of the best purchases I made in the recent past. I love the retina display on the new iPad. I have been using it on my iPhone 4S, but it's even more eye-popping on the iPad. Watching movies on the iPad is such a treat that I have not been turning on my plasma TV anymore.	
342	4	3	4	3	4	0	0	4	1	0	0	0	Look What It Did To Me!!!!!!!!!! This  Ipad was amazing because as soon as I bought I thought it would be great... It turned about that I was wrong. I let my baby use it and it broke. As soon as I told my wife she went into to cardiac arrest and my baby turned into a werewolf. I was soon over taken by the zombies that made a cult in my basement. The whole city of Southboro was OVERTAKEN AND I HAD TO MOVE. In recap the Ipad made me lose my wife my baby and my house (Not to mention the city of Southboro).	
343	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	Good. This product is very Good I suggest you to buy it!!!  I really like itIt came on time and it is exactly like the picture	
344	3	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	2	1	3	4	The new iPad is Hot! Literally! Still a Great Product! This  is a review of the Apple iPad 3 or the "New" iPad as Apple likes to call it. The main question is, should I buy this? The answer will vary from person to person, but I can help you decide to see if it's worth it. First of all, let's take a look at what is new in this version of the iPad. Please note this review will be long so only read the parts that interest you. If you are truely curious, feel free to read the entire thing.Top Things in the NEW iPad: The A5X chip with quad-core graphics drives four times the pixels of iPad 2. The A5X chip is the main thing in the New iPad. It is what delivers the New Stunning Retina Display! With a 2048-by-1536 resolution you can't argue that the New iPad obviously has a way better screen than any other iDevice. With an amazing 10 hours of battery, the new display is really going to get noticed. Due to the fact it now has the A5X chip, the iPad is a lot faster and has really amazing graphics! The new 5MP Eye Sight camera is also something that is really enjoyed on the new iPad. Even though most people aren't really used to taking pictures with a 9.7 inch display tablet this update might encourage people to do so.Now, Let's get into detail. I will break up the review in segments in order to make it more convinient for you all.==== The A5X Chip ====You might be asking, " Is the new chip really such a difference?" The answer to this question is, yes. The new A5X chip, although not seen, is what makes the new iPad so great. It is the source behind the improved graphics, faster responces, and even the really improved Retina Display! Trust me, the new iPad is something truely amazing!==== 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight Camera ====The new rear camera on the iPad is now a 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight camera! What is Eye sight ? Let me put it this way. It is similar to professional DSLR Cameras with Autofocus. That's right, the new iPad has similar features to professional DSLR's. With really good Macro Focus and all-around high quaity pictures. Although 5 Mega Pixels is not that high, the pictures still look really nice on the iPad's Retina Display. MegaPixels matter, but there are other things like Aperature and shutter speed that have a dramatic effect on pictures. This is what is new on the iPad's camera. There is stilll room for improvement in the cameara. They could add a Flash which would make the camera truely spectacular. For now though, the camera is definitely a great improvement from the iPad 2.==== The Battery Life ====Now the battery life on the new iPad can vary from user to user. If you are those types of people that enjoy having the Best Display at all times the battery life is going to be reduced drastically. You can get more life by changing the screen brightness. The iPad has a nice feature to it called Auto-Brightness. This enables the iPad to automatically turn the brightness of the screen higher when you are outdoors and when you are indoors it automatially lowers the brightness to the point where it is just right. On auto-brightness the battery can still last a good 10 continuous hours. This means using it 10 hours non stop. Of course most people don't do this. They leave it on standby. If you only use it a couple of times per day the life can range to maybe 2 full days. Since the battery is larger and it lasts longer it takes more time to charge than an iPod or an iPhone.==== The Display ====As I mentioned before, the display is amazing on the new iPad; however, it is something so great that I can't cover in a review. The best way to decide is seeing it for yourself. I would recommend seeing one in person for you can truely observe the new display with your own eyes.With all of this said, What can an iPad Really do? I will answer this in the sections below...An iPad is basically a computer in some words. It can really be a computer with the right accessories. Some required things to take full advantage of an iPad are:* A wireless printer that supports Apple's Air Print.* An Apple TV to stream with Air Play.* A Bluetooth wireless keyboard that is supported with the iPad* A good case to protect your iPad.Let's take a look at what an iPad can truely do...==== Air Play ====If you have an Apple TV you can stream wirelessly to your HDTV. For Example, If you want to share some pictures with your family, now you can with Air Play. You can wirelessly send infromation to Your HDTV in which you will be able to see pretty much everything you see on your iPad. From Youtube videos to Photos to even Netflix.==== Air Print ====If you have a wireless printer that supports Air Print you can now print straight from your iDevice. For example, you have a PDF file that you just edited or a really great Picture that you just took. With Air Print you can print this from basically anywhere in the world. Even if you are in another county you can send an e-mail to your printer and your printer will wirelessly & Automatically start printing out whatever you sent it! This is someething truely amazing!==== Games & Apps ====With an iPad you have a wide variety of applications and games that you can install on it. With Apple's App sotre there are literally hundreds of apps to choose from with most ranging from FREE to around $5. There are two types of applications on iPads. There are normal apps that were meant for use with an iPod Touch or an iPhone and then there are HD Apps. The High Definition apps were meant for iPad only and they look a lot better than iPhone Apps; however, both are fully functional. The Games will look a lot better on the new iPad as it now has the A5X chip.==== Dictation ====Dictation is a new feature on the iPad. It allows you to speak text. An example would be writing a note in the notes section of the iPad. Instead of typing it out slowly, you can now just say it and the iPad will turn it into text! Save time by literally talking to your iPad. This is also very helpful when sending e-mails.==== Siri ? ====Apple has released to us that in its new update that is coming soon it will allow the new iPad to be used with Siri! The main feature that made the iPhone 4S such a big hit is now going to be integrated into the iPad. Just another great reason to buy an iPad 3.==== iOS ====iOS is the magic behind the  iPad. It lets you see and do everything using Multi-Touch. Apple likes to boast about it being the worlds most advanced mobile oberating system. With every update making it even better, this is a true reason to buy an Apple Device.==== iCloud ====iCloud is new in ios 5 allowing your iPad to update its self with the "cloud" wirelessly of course! You no longer need to own a computer to own an iPad because of this amazing new feature! It also allows you to store all of your apps, music, and movies in the cloud! With this said, it automatically pushes all of your pictures, apps, etc to all of your other iDevices wirelessly! It also allows you to restore an iPad and get all of your contacts and information automatically if you ever have to restore an iPad.Overall:This is a truely outstanding product that is just amazing. The only reason why this is not a 5 Star product is because it tends to be hot! Literally it gets really hot if you use it for around 2 hours. This and the fact that it can still be improved in some areas. Overall though it is a great product that I would not hesitate to buy. I recommend this product for everyone who is looking for a Tablet. I hope that this review helped you guys out. If it did please feel free to say that it helped you out in the buttons below. Thanks.	
345	4	3	3	4	4	0	1	2	0	4	0	4	Sad. Even the iPad is a great device, the apple app store dosn't describe well the applications. For example, I have paid 20 dollars looking for microsoft office app; when I'm going to use it, the 20 dollars' app is really a tutorial to supposedly become an office expert. It was really frustanting. Plus, in order to transer files from my desktop to my iPad, I was charged for another 20 dollars thanks to iTunes download (on my desktop), price that never was ask to my beacuse it said it was free.To sum up, iPad is a great device, but the app store is frustating.	
346	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	3	4	IPad 3. I really love my ipad.  It has beautiful color, very vivid and game playing is a plus on this ipad.  The only thing I wish I really had is a usb port and 32gb., but that is the only downfall of this tablet.	
347	3	3	4	4	4	4	0	1	0	0	4	4	iPad 3 review. I bought my IPad from amazon.com, and I am very pleased with my purchase. The IPad was in very great condition, even though I purchased the IPad used. I am very satisified  with my investment!  After using the camera, which I love, I found out u can only email five picture at one time, when using the share photo  program. I love my IPad,  you would if you have one too!	
348	3	4	4	4	4	3	1	0	1	4	3	4	Pretty good but slow. It's good. Downloads can be slow. Lots of ads that aren't asked for at inappropriate times. It's always evolving and you never know if you purchased the best one.	
349	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	0	2	4	4	Awesome. What can I say that hasn't already been said. This thing goes everywhere with me.  The display is unbelievable and the 4g wireless is faster than heck.  Photos and video are so beautiful.  If I mistakenly leave it at home, I go through serious withdrawal!!! I use it for business as well as personal use.  Highly recommended purchase	
350	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	0	0	1	3	4	Still the best tablet 3 years later. My iPad 2 started to have memory issues when running more than one app or many browser tabs at the same time. I was hoping to use my iPad 2 for 2 years and get the iPad 4. I decided to try the newest android tablet the Samsung note 10.1. I experienced many issues on it and in the end I missed the usability, reliability and apps of my iPad 2. I decided to get the iPad 3 and am very happy with it so far. It is more expensive and has less features than the Samsung note 10.  But it is still the best tablet on the market hands down. The iPad is really easy to use, has a huge app market for tablets, good support, good build quality, lots of accessories, retina display and air play.  When I first read about the iPad 3's retina display I thought it was a gimmick. After owning and using it I do see the difference with the screen. Since I spend a huge amount of time on my iPad 3 (mostly reading) it makes sense to get a better screen. They say it's suppose to be better on your eyes even if you have bad eye sleight. I also see the difference when watching videos or viewing pictures. In terms of speed I don't really notice the difference from my iPad 2. The extra ram is probably the main thing I've benefited from by getting the iPad 3. I do wish apple would improve the speakers on the iPad by making them stereo and not down facing. That's once thing I miss from the Samsung note 10. The samsung note 10 also had the ability to do real multitasking not the seudo stuff apple does. The note 10 could also run apps simultaneously side by side. These are things apple could do to improve their tablet even more. Although the iPad 3 is only slightly heavier and thicker than the iPad 2, I still notice the difference. I know that apple had to put a larger battery to power the higher resolution screen, LTE and processor.  I just think its unlike apple to release a product that is heavier, thicker and offers less battery life than it's predecessor. I haven't updated to iOS 6 yet as I heard it slows down the device, gets rid of YouTube/google maps and wifi issues. I am waiting for an update and also a jailbreak for ios 6. I am looking forward to Siri for the iPad 3, browser enhancements, email enhancements and Facebook integration. In the end apple won me over with air play since I own 2 apple tv 2's. No other tablet or mobile device anything like air play or as easy to use as AirPlay.Early November 2012 update: Well Apple screwed us iPad 3 owners by releasing a new iPad just 6 months after this one. The iPad 4 has a faster A6X chip, dual channel bonding wifi, a hd front camera and lightning connector. The new chip is suppose to make the iPad 4 twice as fast as the iPad 3. The dual channel bonding will make wifi connectivity twice as fast when connected to a n network support router. The lightning connector is suppose to charge the ipad 4 about 45 minutes quicker than the previous version. Personally I wanted an iPad that was thinner, lighter, had more ram and stereo speakers. Do yourself a favor dont buy the Ipad 4. Wait for the iPAd 5 which will most probably be thinner, lighter, stereo speakers and more ram and look like the ipad mini. In my case I was within 3 weeks. The apple store let me return mine for a full refund. I came home and placed an order for a iPad 3 refurb. I got my refurb wifi 64gb for only $550. Which is a great deal. I really dont know why Apple couldnt have waited a few more months for a newer version. Who knows maybe Apple will release a new iPAd in march or april again. The only reason to get an ipad 4 is if you do alot of gaming, photo editing or video editing otherwise your not really going to notice the difference or be worth your while. Save your money and get the ipad 3 refurb or just wait until the ipad 5.

What's not to like especially when I can work from home, watch a movie, read a book, browse the internet and use it in the classroom with educational aps for the kids. Haven't used the camera yet.The teenager is constantly trying to get her hands on it. But I do confess that when I cannot figure something out the teen can, so its a trade off at times.	
352	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	1	4	4	Amazing! I am absolutely pleased with my pours hashed product and how quick it came to me in the mail. Will be doing business with this company again in the near future!

I was not impressed because:(1) Its almost the same exact thing as the iPad 2. (Ooh Retina display! Great.)(2) It runs iOs, not Android. Enough said.(3) Not much different from other tablets. (And the iPad was NOT the first tablet.)Though their are some pros:(1) Makes a GREAT paperweight! I can not tell you how many papers this thing could hold down!(2) Efficient weapon. The screen breaks so easily that if you are under attack, grab the nearest iPad (check the trash cans, you will find one within your first few tries) break the screen, and defend yourself with the glass!	
354	3	3	4	4	4	0	4	0	0	4	3	3	I like it, but wish it had some Android-like features. I picked this up a little over 2 weeks ago at my local Best Buy and really wasn't impressed when I started using it. I always wondered why there was so much hype surrounding Apple products. It's a beautiful tablet, both the body and the screen. I just thought Apple would've shaken things up a bit instead of using the same mundane icon layout etc. The good thing is that it gets the work done that I need, the extras that I want are just not there. For example, no auto-fill when typing URL's, lack of Flash player, no built in HDMI port, no notepad for me to write on unlike the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and the so-so sound quality. I've gotta tell ya, the Kindle HD sounds way better. There are some other features I wish the iPad had, but I won't get into that.What I'll say is that I like the sturdiness. It feels like they used good quality material to construct this. Battery life is simply amazing, I rarely need to charge it. It connects quickly to the internet. I like the sharp retina display, the ease of transitioning from one app or website to another. It's very smooth, the best I've seen in any tablet and I've purchased and returned a few in my quest to find a really good one (Kindle Fire HD, Blackberry Playbook, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 & the Asus Transformer TF700T). I think Apple got me by the sheer volume of apps they have and so many of them are free! It's amazing to have such a vast array of apps that are dedicated to this one product.I like it enough to keep it plus I'm tired of returning tablets. I'll just have to learn how to manipulate it. The owner's manual online should really help with this.	
355	4	4	4	3	4	0	2	0	4	0	4	4	Perfect for my 91 yr old Mother-in-Law! Mother-in-Law had trouble learning to use regular computer so we purchased this iPad for her and she is doing wonderfully with it. She is so excited and uses it for hours every day!	
356	3	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	0	0	0	1	Not impressed..... For the price I wanted more than a 10" Iphone.....there is no USB support, no file swapping, and you cannot hook anything else up to it unless Apple deems it ok via Itunes.....what a useless product.  If you have an Iphone 1/2/3/4/4s/5/5s, Ipod, Ipad 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/nano you have already have an Ipad.  The boring limited IOS is the same across all systems adding zero new functionality.  I was going to buy one of these until I looked at the Iphone I used to use (until I scrapped it for a Nokia Lumia 800) next to one of these IPAD's, laughed out loud and waited for the Microsoft Surface tablet/PC which is actually a fully functional tablet/laptop hybrid PC that doesn't need Itunes and a seperate PC to do simple tasks or transfer anything.  What a joke this is and I bet the same people who bought this will run out and buy an Ipad mini then the Ipad nano (4") Ipad Rofl.

If you're looking to be productive (school / work,) a netbook may be better for you. If you're just looking for web surfing, games, magazines, radio and podcasts, and overall entertainment, treat yourself with an iPad.

359	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	4	4	We Love This Thing! I bought this for my wife for Christmas and wound up giving it to her early (because I couldn't wait).  She absolutely loves it.  She has a quality laptop that she used to take with her so that she could get online if necessary, but having to cart around a laptop is a hassle.  The Ipad fits in her purse and is so practical.No one should think this is a replacement for a laptop - it's not, but it is great for email, browsing the web, and streaming.  She also loves the camera to take pics of grandkids.  It's only 5mp, but still looks good.  Being able to add apps is another thing she loves.Well made and extremely easy to use.  As usual, Apple's quality shows.  I highly recommend it.

361	3	3	4	4	3	0	2	4	4	0	3	4	Toy-ish. A "Paying for the name" tablet.  If your prioritary to Apple, then this is for you.  If not there are a few others that rival this item.  Arrived a bit cracked, but the packaging was excellent.  Perhaps the cold helped.  IPAD for me are more for the artsy fartsy lie, which I am.  But the cost just for a qualified "tool" of art, without the computer back up was too much for my finances.	
362	4	4	4	4	3	4	0	4	0	3	4	4	Wife loves it. We got this Ipad for the family, and no really has been able to touchit since my wife started it up!

I love that i can take my library with me,my bible study tools with me and fits easily into my purse.I wanted a bigger size than the mini and love it, the ease with which apple products work is amazing, compared to android. I will always choose apple over any other.	
366	1	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	3	4	1	4	It's more fun to look at or read about than to actually use it. I never had another tablet, so can't compare - this is strictly "1st time user experience".Also, I never used Apple's products (have a long UNIX/DOS/Windows history, though), so some of the disappointment is probably caused by general Apple policies/approaches, not by this particylar iPad...So, the one good thing I can say: the graphics look good - good resolution, good colors, etc.Plus, the camera works not too bad - but only for static or very slowly moving objects; also needs good lighting - in bad lighting the image gets very grainy (but that's not a professional camera, after all...)The rest I like much less... - It's rather heavy for its size, so holding it 'casually' is out of question: you have to hold it with one hand (using the other to operate the screen), you can't put you fingers around opposit edges like you'd do with a smaller phone; so you have to balance it horizontally on your palm with spread fingers - good if you have big hands and long fingers, otherwise just go to the nearest table... If you want to use it at an angle (e.g., while sitting in an armchair or lying on a sofa) - you still can kind of prop it on one hand (e.g., bottom edge on your palm and a few fingers behind it for a prop) - but your hand will start getting numb in just a few minutes (remember the weight!!!)- Sound: given its size, I didn't really expect it to have Bose quality, but still, it's rather more rattling than I care to listen to music with...- Battery: it never really gave "...Up to 10 Hours of Battery Life...", and with time it dies faster, and takes longer to recharge - now it only takes it ~2 hours to go from 100% to 8% (and it's been less than a month!!!)- Cord: power cord is extremely short (never seen something similar in my life!!!), so, if you want to use it while plugged in (remember the battery life?) you need an extension cord - with the bulgy adapter dangling just below your knees (when standing - figure out where it'll be when you're sitting or lying down) - It might be not a bad idea for a new product: "belt clip for the iPad's extension cord"...- I resent the idea of 'sandboxes' for applications, where each application can see only its own data and nothing else: e.g., if I have two applications capable of viewing PDF files, and I download/save a PDF with one application, I can't open it with the other; or if you have two 'file managers', each one's storage will be separate, so you have to remember which files are managed with which manager... And if you try to install a 'better file manager', moving your files from the old one is a nightmare (if you figure how at all)... Honestly, 'Jailbreak' seems almost a must... :-(- Applications: yes, applications are provided by different vendors; but there are some that come preinstalled - and some of them suck big time... (e.g., Safari, the web browser, etc. - but that's a separate big topic...)P.S. One thing I forgot to mention - if kept 'On' for > 1 hour, it heats quite noticeably; at 2+ hours it can be almost burning the holding hand...	
367	3	4	3	4	4	4	1	0	2	4	4	4	Love the iPad 3. I really enjoy the white iPad. Siri and the new retina display are great! It is worth the money if you are considering between an Ipad 2 and Ipad 3.

369	4	4	3	4	4	4	2	0	4	4	4	4	Wonderful. Oh iPad, how I love you. A fantastic multi-purpose device. It was already a strong product but when they added the high quality display it became a must own piece of hardware. Movies, comics, tooling around online, etc.

When it arrived the charger didn't work which sucked but I contacted amazon and instead of making me return it, they just refunded me $75 so I could go buy a new charger locally ($75 is way more than a charger costs). Very happy!It's a little sluggish on some of the apps I use but I knew that when I chose to buy a couple generations old.	
382	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	Love my iPad! Love, love, love my iPad!  I wanted an upgrade from my mini to the regular size and found this on Amazon Warehouse deals.

383	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	4	4	4	4	Great. I was very happy with this - it was absolutely like new. It came cleanly packaged with charger and it works perfectly.

But I have a leather cover on it so you don't see those nicks on the corners. So far it was a good purchase for refurbished iPad three.I traded in an iPad one which was in excellent condition but slower than I wanted. I don't think I got what it was worth but all they offered me was $79 on Amazon.I'm satisfied with the upgrade.	
393	4	4	4	4	3	0	3	2	0	4	4	4	Great. I got this iPad for my dad and he absolutely loves it. when he is home on his day off, he won't put it down.	
394	4	3	4	3	2	2	0	4	3	1	4	4	Nice Tablet, have a Kindle Fire to compare. This is a very nice tablet.  The screen is very clear and detailed.I have a Kindle Fire, so will compare that to the Ipad3.  I know they are priced much differently, but I have a Kindle and was questioning if the Ipad3 was a good upgrade.First the obvious:Apple has a bigger screen.IOS vs AndroidMain menus:The IPAD main menu scrolls smoother between screens and when opening applications.  The Kindle default Amazon interface is kind of lame and too simple, however I use a side loaded app called Go Launcher on the Kindle.Go Launcher has onscreen buttons for home and back (which is the same type of interface on an Android).  With the Ipad you have to press the hard button over to the side to go back to the home menu.On screen buttons like with Go Launcher are nice, example... if I am in email then open a url this will open up the web browser.  When I want to return back to that email I simply just press the onscreen back button while in web browser and this will take me back to the email I was just looking at.With the Ipad if you are in email and press on a url the web browser opens as normal, but you have to press the hard button to get out of the browser and back to the app menu, and then press the email app.  This seems kind of redundant to me.  Another option with the Ipad3 is you can hit the home button twice to access your open apps and press the email program.The Android onscreen navigation buttons are more intuitive for this purpose.Screen:The Kindle Fire screen looks very good but looking closely (12 inches away) I can still see the pixelation on smaller pictures.The Ipad Retina is for sure more clear and sharp.  The pictures are more vivid and detailed.  Text looks much sharper.Internet:Ipad3 web browsing is faster than the Kindle but there are still some occasional delays when scrolling down a webpage on the Ipad, but much less than the Kindle Fire.  Using the Safari browser is more responsive.  The larger screen on the IPAD3 is way nicer for web browsing.  With the Kindle Fire there is a lot more side scrolling going on and moving around the screen to browse the web.The onscreen keyboard:Ipad is very responsive and I don't feel like I have to guess if the onscreen key I hit was registered.The Kindle was not as responsive.  While the onscreen keyboard is good, there times when the Kindle just seems to hiccup and not register an onscreen key.Email:The Ipad built in email integrates with my MS Live account.The Kindle built in email doesn't work with MS Live, you have to get a different program which really sometimes does not pull up new email and the navigation is clunky.Music streaming:Pandora Radio works fine on both.  The Ipad has one speaker, and the Kindle has two for stereo affect.  The Kindle sound is very good for the price, but when tilted horizontally the speakers are on the left side and one of the speakers gets covered up when held up.  I think the Ipad3 sound is better, however the speaker faces away so the sound can be distant when propped up.Video streaming:Netflix on the Ipad3 is way better; the movies look clear and stream in HD.  The Kindle movies look blotchy and appear to be playing at a lower resolution.Google maps and locationing:Kindle Fire has no location positioning for locationing apps.The Ipad3, has no GPS, but can still use wireless positioning to locate the Ipad location like in Google Maps._____________So the Ipad3 is way better than the Kindle, surprise!!  My only gripe is there are no onscreen navigation buttons to jump to other applications.  Pressing the hard button is not a big issue, but I rather only use that button sparingly.I like the Ipad3 for most tasks including email, browsing the web, streaming movies.I like the Kindle Fire for compact use and I prefer the smaller size for traveling lightly.	
395	4	3	4	4	2	2	4	3	1	4	4	4	First Tablet... Amazing!! I never have had a tablet before. I decided I was going to get one for school and I'm a freshman in college. Overall, completely satisfied with my purchase. I wasn't one hundred percent sure between this or the iPad 2 and I think I made the right decision. I would definitely recommend the 32 gigabyte model because you'll need the space with the HD apps. Although I've never owned another tablet I feel like this is the best one out there right now. I recommend this to any person thinking of getting a tablet for the first time.Pros:Awesome screenFastGreat app storeAwesome gamesPerfect for taking notesCons:Not as customizable as AndroidIf you're taking notes for college, I would suggest a stylus for handwritten notes.	
396	3	4	1	4	4	3	4	2	4	4	2	3	It's just a shame! Connection and Photo Syncing Annoyances. I actually bought the Ipad 3, 64GB wi-fi version from Apple maybe a month or so ago.  Long story short is that I absolutely love the Ipad for everything it can do, BUT, there were two reasons why I ultimately returned it:1. Connections:  I still really find it annoying that the only connection you have to this Ipad is the normal connection as seen on every single previous version of the Ipad.  Look, I know there is that adapter that you can buy separately that connects a USB cord to the Ipad as well as the SD card as well:[...]But, the general public that has bought the item specifically for the Ipad 3 are consistently complaining that it is very shotty and doesn't really work.2. THE BIG ONE!!!:  Itunes and the TERRIBLE interface when trying to sync photos from your computer (either PC or Mac ... and for me specifically a PC with Windows 7, 64bit), to the Ipad 3.  Not, Ipad 2, I'm taking about the Ipad 3.  Why is nobody complaining about this HUGE problem on this site?  If you don't believe me, just type in "Ipad 3 Photo Syncing Problem" on Google, and be amazed.  If you want to save the time, click on the below link which will take you directly to the blog as discussed on Apple's own community website.[...]Just start from that page and read on through 23 other pages, of complaints with this issue.  Some people offered solutions, some worked, but the bottom line is is that Apple continues to deny this problem, and there has been no recent fix/update with Itunes to remedy it.  Even though Itunes update 10.6.1 says:About iTunes 10.6.1iTunes 10.6.1 provides a number of improvements, including:* Fixes several issues that may cause iTunes to unexpectedly quit while playing videos, changing artwork size in Grid view, and syncing photos to devices.So, all in all, once Apple fixes this issue, I will not get the Ipad 3 again.  People reading this, please post your comments if you are experiencing the same annoyance that I experienced.  It is truly a shame as the majority of people that buy this product want to use it to show off their amazing high rez photos on the beautiful Retina Display that the Ipad 3 has.Thoughts?	
397	4	3	4	2	1	2	0	4	3	0	4	4	Wow. It arrived very quickly and was well packaged. Kudos to the seller. As for the Ipad, well its an Ipad and it is awesome. Apple is well known for its nearly trouble free products and simple user interfaces. if you are going to invest in a tablet and do not plan on using it for mass memory storage the ipad is the only thing to be considering.Thoughts from another satisfied Amazon Customer.	
398	1	2	4	4	3	0	2	4	4	2	1	3	Limited functions compared to even a cheap laptop running Windows. I tried two Android based tablets (Galaxy Tab and Acer A500) and sent them both back for one problem or another.  The Acer was the worst.  At the urging of my Apple fanboy brother I bought an iPad.With the iPad, get ready to spend money to make the thing work like Windows 2.0.  Using iTunes to move files from my PC to the iPad is like using some clunky shareware program from 1998.  Apple hates Windows so much they torture Windows users with the iTunes program.Tablets, Apple or Android, are limited computers that substitute slick and snazzy graphics on a super nice screen for actual wide functionality and reconfigurability, essentially they are smart phones with a bigger screen and no phone.I really think people like the iPad because of it's slick design, clever graphics, and compact size, and so make excuses for all it's functional limitations.  For me the vaunted iPad and Apple iOS is a huge disappointment and offers less than Android which itself isn't that great.I'll probably send this back and try another Android tablet because I miss having an SD card slot, proper USB port, and simple access to files on my PC.	
399	3	2	4	4	4	2	4	0	3	4	4	4	I love it. I've had Apple products before, and I've been considering an iPad. I finally took the leap.Admittedly, when I first got it, it felt like a luxurious toy -- and perhaps it is. I kept saying to myself, "my Macbook can do this" or, "Do I really need this app?"But finally, what it boiled down to was that I was having so much fun with my new iPad. It was a mixture of both practical, functional apps and wonderfully fun apps. I concentrated on free apps and already have so many good ones downloaded. I have books and magazines to read, including audiobooks which can be read to me before I fall asleep, and apps to help me with things like finding yard sales in my neighborhood or Manga Storm, which is marvelous for reading manga on the iPad. There's Glympse, which lets everyone know where you are at any given moment.This may be the Wi-Fi version, but in my city it has its advantages. My ISP is providing free Wi-Fi hotspots for its customers around the city, and is adding more all the time. I imagine other ISPs will follow suit. Wi-Fi may soon be in competition with 3G and 4G. It sounds far-fetched, but at least in my city, it isn't, although a few years ago it would have been. So I can get connected in a lot more places for free, which is nice.I'm very impressed with everything about the iPad, from the display to the controls to the sound. I don't have an iPad 2 or an original iPad to compare it to, as this is my first one. All I can say is that I am very happy with mine.I got a beautiful case for it that I just love: the Osaki iCoat Slim Y+ Hard Case and Cover for The New iPad and the iPad 2. It fits both the new iPad and the iPad 2. What I love is that the front of the case is like a Smart Cover, except that it does both portrait and landscape modes. The front cover attaches not to your iPad, however: instead, it attaches to the back case. I also got a nifty little stand, the Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand for Apple iPad, Galaxy Tab, BlackBerry Play Book. It works great in both portrait and landscape mode and is great for charging.I also want to say a word about screen brightness, since some people have mentioned about the iPad overheating. I was worried about this prior to getting mine. Yes, if you have a bare iPad and you run a game or a very graphic intensive app, the iPad may get a little warm. However I have found that most of the time, the brightness level that the iPad is set on, which is around 50%, is fine for me. There have been a few times when I have raised it to 75%, and there have also been a few times when I have lowered it to 25%. But mostly I keep it at 50%. I keep my Macbook's screen at 100% brightness. So I like a bright screen. But the 50% brightness on the iPad is really bright to me. The only exception is if there is a game and it has a really dark scene. Then maybe I want to turn up the brightness a bit, or maybe I want to dim the lights in the room. It depends on the game.However, most of the time, people are not going to have a bare iPad if they are thinking about protecting it against dropping it. Usually they will have AppleCare+ or some type of protection plan. Mine went right into my case as soon as I got the case. So with the case on it, I really do not feel any heat. The heat I was mentioning was when I was playing games on it when it was bare, before I got a case for it.Also, if you've never had an iPad, I learned from Apple tech support you can only have 11 pages of apps on the iPad (you can have unlimited apps stored on iTunes or in iCloud). But you can put apps in folders. So at least there is that option!All I can say is, if you've never had an iPad and you're on the fence, this is a beautiful device. I'm extremely happy with mine. The only thing I would wish for is more storage. I got the 64GB but it still feels like for things like photos, videos and movies that I would like more storage.The iPad third generation is amazing: you won't regret your purchase. I'm thrilled with mine.	
400	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	3	3	1	4	4	Great Purchase. This came as good as or better than expected. Received it quickly and in the condition that it was advertised. Love it. I have a hard time putting a book down and am happy to be able to buy the sequel on the fly.	
401	4	4	3	4	0	3	4	0	4	2	4	4	Ipad purchase by older generation ! Never have had and "I" anything so this was new for us. Found it pretty easy to operate and very versatile to use. Being the older generation I prefer to have a copy of a written manual and find it easier to use. But, I was able to find my way around the manual in the sky ! My wife in particular has used it more than I have and she really likes it. My wife has less computer experience than I do and has been able to navigate it quite well.	
402	4	3	4	2	4	3	2	4	4	4	4	4	1080p support is worth the upgrade. I have been extremely happy with my purchase of the iPad 3. I have a lot of movies on my home server in 1080p and with the help of third party apps, they play brilliantly. My partner has never liked his iPhone 4 because it is too small, but I have to literally take the iPad from him. I also have not used my desktop since receiving this thing. My desktop is an awesome $4500.00 dual loop liquid cooled customized beast. Lately it has just been sitting there.I think I see another iPad 3 in our future. I hope they don't go up too much higher before we get another one.	
403	4	2	3	1	4	4	2	4	0	3	3	4	ipad 3 16G with At&t; 4G - very good, not perfect. The new ipad is very good for one job, browsing the web: reading online news, books, searching various information. Typing is pretty good, but I did not try to do work on it. The spell auto-correct function is sometimes annoying. Some programs simply don't work on it. It is much faster than the Kindle fire. I find the camera 1) not so useful 2) possibly less good than in the iphone 4. It connects to a wi-fi network flawlessly.This being said, the casing is slippery and one has to buy a protective case. Once this is done, which is inevitable if you really want to make sure an accidental slip would not wreck your ipad, the options are restricted to hefty cases (I have the Otterbox Defender). At this point your device morphed into a heavy, bulky  not so elegant netbook without a lid. Add a screen protector (included) and the once superb display is just grainy but yes, extremely responsive. It is of course an extremely fast, responsive tablet, about the right size and worth 4 stars. However, not five, as it costs way too much compared to a laptop.A word of caution about 4G: I decided to pay more to have this feature, motivated in part by the new sharing plans from At&t; (which I did not sign up for yet) and the unreliability of cable internet providers in my area. 4G (LTE) does not really work everywhere on the At&t; coverage map. My iphone works perfectly on 3G but 4G is dead in my house. It is not clear to me if I can force the ipad to use the 3G network, but my first impression, from admittedly superficial research, is that a locked device would not accept it.The ipad is good, but not a necessity. Purists may disagree with a comparison to the iphone 4 (in my case). But the iphone does everything the ipad does; its form factor makes it amazing, versatile and indispensable. At 10in screen size, all that seems unexceptional.	
404	3	4	4	4	4	0	0	2	4	4	4	4	Rocks My Socks! It is the best thing since sliced bread!  Love my iPad.  The whole family uses it.  Kids read books on it which is a great way to get them into reading more, especially considering the books can be very interactive.  Great for quickly looking stuff up with out busting out a bulky lap top.  Games, movies, apps...seriously really fun!  When the iPad 1st came out, I thought I really wouldn't buy one because it's just like the iPhone, but having that big screen for certain things is really great!	
405	2	3	4	0	0	3	2	4	0	3	4	4	IPad 3. I normally try to avoid Apple products, bit I'm glad I bought this. Granted the left side gets slightly warm while using it but it's hardly noticeable. You really have to be looking for defects and not be fair to write a bad review on this Tab. I had an Asus EEE Pad Transformer that was awesome when it worked, unfortunately it crashed every two and a half weeks, I've owned the IPad for almost a month and a half still runs like day one.The only thing that bothers me about it is it's lack of a flash player, but there is probably a patch for it and since I'm not an Apple guy I don't know of it.	
406	3	4	3	2	4	4	2	4	0	0	3	3	So far, so good. I am not an Apple lover. I wanted to get a tablet PC due to the portability and convenience. Family and friends use and like the iPad. They speak highly of it, therefore, I decided to try out the iPad as opposed to the Samsung Galaxy Note.Things I like: The iPad is light, convenient, the screen resolution is great. It is pretty easy to use, connects with wireless sites with ease and no hassle, the battery life is great.Things I dont like: There is no "arrow key" to move the cursor backward, forward, up or down to position the cursor where you want it to correct spelling or add words. The backspace "key" is the only way to move the cursor and it erases characters. The touch screen allows you to place the cursor where you want it, but it isn't always responsive to my attempts to place the cursor where I want it; so this too can be awkward for making corrections etc. I ordered a stylus. I hope the stylus will make this a little more tolerable. Bookmarks are weird. I have used Safari. Chrome, Yahoo Axis and none handle bookmarks very well. I suppose it is something I need to get used to.	
407	4	4	3	2	4	2	0	4	3	4	3	4	Excellent! Just some defects on the back cover. Really the iPad I want. But I don't know How much I could sell it to get the latest one.	
408	4	4	3	4	4	1	4	4	4	1	4	4	what a great gift. I purchased this ipad as a gift for a birthday... my brother is always using mine and loves it. So now he has his own to personalize ... what a surprise. Amazon made it so easy to purchase it and deliver it so quickly.	
409	3	3	4	4	3	4	3	1	4	4	4	4	Love it. Doesnt completely replace the needs for a laptop but who cares.  Works great and no complaints.So much more fun than my iphone for games.	
410	4	4	4	3	0	4	2	4	3	4	4	4	love my I-pad. my wife loves her I-pad that means I really love it (but filling out these reviews I are a waste of my time)	
411	4	3	2	4	4	4	0	2	0	4	4	4	Flora. The product is in accordance with the description. I am a student and I buy the iPad mainly for study, so I think it's a good deal, thanks.	
412	4	4	3	4	1	4	4	2	0	4	4	4	Great product for my 13-year-old. I didn't know much about the iPad except that my 13-year-old son had to have it.  I choose the generation one down from the very latest as of now (Dec. 2012).  The graphics are stunning, and my son says it was his best Christmas present ever (and I've always spoiled that kid).  Also, I got it from the seller in "like new" condition.  And true to their word, it looked absolutely new and even came with the original plastic over it.  I saved nearly $100 by getting it used, however, so I was extremely happy about that..Anyway, I can't speak to any of the higher functionality that others may be looking for in an iPad.  All I know is that I continue to be impressed with it the more my son uses it.	
413	4	4	3	4	4	4	2	3	4	3	4	4	I really love the iPad! The tablet is perfect for me and my needs.  I am really happy with my choice. I am able to watch movies, listen to music and post on Facebook and Pinterest.  Plus the apps I have downloaded. Very happy with my choice!	
414	3	3	3	0	1	4	1	4	0	0	2	2	Very good. Very good product.  The camera button takes more than one touch to work.  Also I notice the lower left corner is slow to work.  I may not have the right touch but I noticed everything else works on the first touch.  Thank you,	
415	4	2	4	1	3	0	3	0	0	2	2	2	My 1st. I Pad. I really didn't know what I would use this jewel for.  Pretty user friendly and getting more familiar with it daily.  I mean you get no instructions with this thing except a web based users guide that I stumbled across.  I can watch Netflix on it now.  Needs a pretty good Wi-Fi signal though or else it looses contact with the web.  Would I pay this much again.  I doubt it.	
416	3	3	1	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	Love it. I got this iPad for my wife for Christmas.  It came in perfect condition and works great. We all take turns using it on the wireless network and have had no problems at all.

419	2	3	4	4	4	3	2	4	4	0	4	4	iPad 3 aka "The New iPad" This was a birthday gift for my wife and she's loved it. We've had it for almost a year now and have not had any issues with it. We both had iPhones prior to this, so we were already familiar with the interface.	
420	4	2	4	4	4	2	3	1	0	4	3	4	Overall, the Ipad 3 was a great purchase. I was lucky to receive the Ipad 3 as a gift from my dad as a graduation present. His goal was to have me use it for college. It has definitely come in handy already and I am only a freshman. I bring it to class instead of my heavy computer, which, trust me, makes a huge difference when you are also carrying a lot of books. There are many uses of the Ipad 3 in a schooling aspect, and also some restrictions. I'll go into both in this review.I will start with the positives of the Ipad 3. First off, it is super lightweight. So if you are interested in carrying it a lot of places, it is a good option. It is small so it can fit in most bags or purses. I wouldn't write an essay on it, but when I need to look something up really quick in class or on campus, I have the option to. It is also good for taking quick notes on, or having something saved so you can show your professor.Something else that is really good about the Ipad 3 (which also goes for all apple products) is the choices of apps. I am taking a French class, which has an online textbook. However it uses Java, which most Ipad internet apps do not support. Through lots of questions and research, our teacher found out that there is an app that supports java. So now I can also access my french book from my iPad using "Puffin" internet browser. Other than that, safari and other internet apps are very useful, fast, and easy to use.The iPad 3 has a "mail" app that is used for your email. It will load the email straight to your iPad, so you can use the app instead of having to log in online. The best thing about this app is that you can load multiple emails to the app, so you can see all of your emails in one place. This might sound overwhelming, but you can sort them in a specific way. Say you have three emails linked to it, and you only want to see the new emails for two of them, you can select and unselect what email shows the unread messages. Something else that is good for school is "math reference" app.I am so glad I have the Ipad 3 because when I was in math class, and lost in the lecture, I could just open up math reference with my Ipad and get a quick answer. There are many helpful apps on the Ipad 3 that you can use for school, and a lot of them you can get for free, or for really cheap. One comes already on the Ipad 3, which is called "iTunes U". This is an app where you can download and save specifically education material. Such as books, courses, and educational videos. More and more now textbooks for certain courses are coming out with the "kindle edition" of their books. Which means if you have the Ipad, you can buy your textbook as a Kindle book and read it in the kindle app. This would make the books astronomically cheaper and of course, be much more convenient because they would all be in one place in a nice, lightweight iPad 3.The iPad 3 makes it very easy to change settings if necessary. All of the apps are easy to move around into the organization that you desire. They are easy to download, or delete. You can easily manipulate almost every aspect to your Ipad from the "settings" app. It is very clear, concise, and easy to use. Even for the technologically challenge. And even if you don't know how to fix something, you can just look it up online. There are tons of forums and Q&A; websites for apple products. There are also a lot of great shortcuts on the iPad 3 to get around easy. For example, the very left page is a search page. If you double click the home button a bar at the bottom shows up with your most previously visited pages. If the iPad is on lock, if you double click the home button, some options will appear for listening to music (if you already have music playing). If you click and hold the home button, you will have access to "Siri". If you click the home button and lock button at the same time, it will take a screenshot.Now for the negatives of the iPad 3. I have very little things to complain about with this product, but of course there are always a few inconveniences. One would be that sometimes the internet stops working. Most of the time it is just my campus internet failing, but sometimes its my iPad. Most of the time, just turning it off and back on will fix it right up. Very, very rarely my iPad will be slow or have apps quit unexpectedly on me. But again, this is very rare.Overall, the Ipad 3 was a great purchase. I use it everyday. I am still looking for my class books to be kindle editions so I can just download them to my iPad. I am sure more will start having kindle editions soon. It is such a great thing to have for my schooling, it is incredible how many things you can do on it to help your education.	
421	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	1	4	4	So far enjoying. So far I like it a lot still kind of getting used to using it but hoping that once I get it all figured out it will be perfect	
422	4	4	2	3	4	4	2	0	4	3	1	4	My Apple ipad does not work. Hello, I am writting to you because I would like to say that I received my iPad but does not work, I went to the istore here in Caracas, Venezuela, and the seller told me that the iPad has a software's problem. What can I do? Thank you in advance.	
423	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	Very good. Although it was latter stolen from me some days after I got it.still it came to me in perfect condition,it worked beautifully .i had no complaint what so ever.very good.	
424	4	4	1	4	3	3	2	4	4	3	0	0	Very bad. I sent a sample ipad when paying an ipad new, take it to the apple for the review and clean up and would not let me delete anything	
425	4	4	4	1	2	4	2	4	3	0	0	0	I received a model with a Refurbished Serial Number and Model Number. I bought the MC705LL/A through Amazon from a marketplace seller, fulfillment by Amazon.  The box that came was the box for a new iPad, but the label under the cellophane on the bottom of the box had serial and model numbers for a refurbished iPad.  The description on the label was "FC705LL/A RFB IPAD WI-FI 16GB BLACK-USA".  Note the "RFB" in the description and the model number starts with F.  The serial number started with DK.  Three signs of it being a refurbished unit.Outside the cellophane on the top of the box was a sticker that had all the information to label it as new, including the word "New" in bold type...I contacted Amazon for a refund.  That went smoothly.  The seller's attitude was that it should have been a new iPad. He said he never sees the boxes of items fulfilled by Amazon; something like his products go straight through Amazon warehouses.  He did point out that refurbished iPads have different boxes with "Certified Refurbished"  printed on the front.  My box was not one of those.After I researched Apple Certified Refurbished, I concluded that a certified refurbished iPad is ok, but I PAID for a new one.  I ended up buying an Apple Certified Rerurbished iPad 3rd Gen at a price point that was in line with it being a refurbished unit.I don't know if this problem was the seller's fault or the fault of the "system."  3rd Generation iPads are no longer in production.  The only models being produced as NEW are: iPad With Retina Display (4th Gen); iPad Mini; and 2nd Generation iPads.  I suspect that any entity selling a 3rd Generation iPad listed as "new" is selling second-hand goods.  It seems to me that Amazon needs to update their product page for the 3rd Gen iPad to reflect this information.	
426	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	3	0	4	4	4	Won't take the place of a laptop, but still exceeds expectations! iPad is super convenient!  It's fast and easy to figure out.  It won't take the place of a PC or laptop, but fulfills a lot of other "needs".	
427	4	2	3	3	4	0	4	4	2	0	4	4	It is a big iphone. I liked a lot. The battery works well. It is a little bit heavy. Now I think I should have bought the small one. But the ipad is great for the ones used to itunes.	
428	4	0	2	4	0	4	3	4	2	2	0	0	Buyer BEWARE of TechGiant -- Does not honor Apple's 1-year warranty. Be very wary of purchasing any tech products from TechGiant.Purchased a 3rd gen ipad from them via Amazon and 8 months later the speaker stopped working.  Contacted Apple with the ipad's serial number and they said it did not exist or was never registered.  Ask TechGiant for assistance and they said they do not offer any warranty over the standard 30 days via Amazon.I asked TechGiant about the 1-year warranty on hardware that comes with all Apple products and TechGiant said that they cannot honor that as they do not know how long the devices have been sitting on their own shelf.  They said that if they bought the ipad from their distributor 6 months before a customer buys it on Amazon from them, there would only be 6 months left on the Apple warranty.This is absolutely not stated on the product page and we were VERY DISAPPOINTED with TechGiant!!!BUYER BEWARE of TechGiant!!!  Ask the how long the "new" device has been sitting on their "shelf" before they sell it to you.  I would never deal with this seller again.  You are better off buying directly from the Apple store.	
429	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	1	4	3	4	Great tablet. Got this for a really good price and with minimal damage. Works great and I can use it for both work and play. Takes a little getting used to how to use it, but I'm enjoying it a lot	
430	4	0	3	1	2	4	3	4	2	4	4	4	iPad was all that I wanted. This seller sold me a 3rd generation iPad that was exactly as presented and had the added bonus of a charging cable included, though their generic ad said that it was just the iPad itself. I am making this review with that very iPad! Thank you!	
431	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	3	4	4	4	Hearts desired fullfilled. Loving it�I recommend this produt to all, ordering is quick, fast and in a hurry. I give it give plus stars	
432	4	4	3	4	3	2	0	4	1	4	4	4	Great!! No complaints! It does what it is supposed to do and has very minimal signs of wear and tear . To top it all off the seller even included a Smart Cover! I recommend getting a heavy duty case for it though as it is pretty fragile in the screen area.	
433	4	4	3	4	4	3	1	4	3	0	4	4	Love it. I do a lot of cross country Harley riding and needed something that could handle the needs of an extended trip, i.e. banking, weather, hotel reservations, communications with the home front etc.but smaller and more packable than a lap top.  This is my first experience with an Apple product and it has exceeded expectations in both capabilities and durability.  The picture taking and sending features are particularly good.  Facetime is a lot of fun as well.  Love it...	
434	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	4	4	3	4	4	Great unit. This is my first iPad.  I'm very happy with the ease of use.  The learning cure is minimal.  I would recommend it.	
435	4	4	3	4	0	2	4	0	1	2	4	4	So far a great purchase. For the price it was in very good condition. A few scratches and nicks on the corners of the back cover. But I have a leather cover on it so you don't see those nicks on the corners. So far it was a good purchase for refurbished iPad three.I traded in an iPad one which was in excellent condition but slower than I wanted. I don't think I got what it was worth but all they offered me was $79 on Amazon.I'm satisfied with the upgrade.	
436	0	4	4	4	0	1	4	0	4	4	0	0	A useless product you will never use, overpriced by Amazon. Everybody who I've spoken to who bought an ipad complains that they barely even used them. I bought this one and after two hours on it realized it's a waste of money. First I browsed all the apps in the store to see how this can benefit my life, and it didn't in any way.All the products were immature as if they were meant for 7-year olds. There is nothing of use here for an adult in the professional world. It's a kids toy, or meant for people who don't have many responsibilities, to feel like they do.On another note, this product only costs $499 in stores, Amazon is attempting to charge over $50 higher here, so if you must have it even though I guarantee you will never use it, don't get ripped off by Amazon.	
437	4	4	4	0	2	2	2	3	1	2	0	4	Integrity !! Yes i got my new iPad's package in a damaged and torn-out condition like I got it from a .. The iPad itself was in good condition though and the amazon package was too which mean that iPad package was damaged in the first place not in shipping	
438	4	4	0	4	3	1	0	4	2	0	4	4	Incredibly pleased.. So far, I love my ipad. It has only been a few days, but already able to move a lot of the stuff I did at work to my ipad..keeps my private information off my work computer and away from prying eyes. I felt a little silly getting one just a year after getting a NookColor, but this is such a better replacement.Now that I have had it for a  while, I absolutely love my iPad. I can't imagine trying to budget, stay in contact, or log into class to post a discussion without it. I love it so much that I upgraded my BlackBerry to an iPhone a month later.	
439	4	0	0	4	4	0	2	3	4	4	4	4	Fantastic! The iPad arrived promptly, in perfect condition, and it does everything I had hoped and much more.So glad I finally pushed myself and ordered this little delight. How did I ever get along without one?	
440	2	3	4	0	4	0	3	4	4	4	2	4	Not a notebook or desktop. Pros: excellent color. Lighter than a desktop or notebook.Cons: Cannot print except to limited number of printers (no lasers). Does not support Adobe Flash - forget most videos. Software different than regular computer. i.e. on Amazon less choices when checking out and less info about products. Touching screen does not always work and ofter works when you do not want it to.  Mouse is more accurate and less mistakes. Still better than Kindle Fire but more expensive.	
441	4	4	4	3	4	2	4	4	2	0	4	4	I love it. I've had Apple products before, and I've been considering an iPad. I finally took the leap.Admittedly, when I first got it, it felt like a luxurious toy -- and perhaps it is. I kept saying to myself, "my Macbook can do this" or, "Do I really need this app?"But finally, what it boiled down to was that I was having so much fun with my new iPad. It was a mixture of both practical, functional apps and wonderfully fun apps. I concentrated on free apps and already have so many good ones downloaded. I have books and magazines to read, including audiobooks which can be read to me before I fall asleep, and apps to help me with things like finding yard sales in my neighborhood or Manga Storm, which is marvelous for reading manga on the iPad. There's Glympse, which lets everyone know where you are at any given moment.This may be the Wi-Fi version, but in my city it has its advantages. My ISP is providing free Wi-Fi hotspots for its customers around the city, and is adding more all the time. I imagine other ISPs will follow suit. Wi-Fi may soon be in competition with 3G and 4G. It sounds far-fetched, but at least in my city, it isn't, although a few years ago it would have been. So I can get connected in a lot more places for free, which is nice.I'm very impressed with everything about the iPad, from the display to the controls to the sound.

However I have found that most of the time, the brightness level that the iPad is set on, which is around 50%, is fine for me. There have been a few times when I have raised it to 75%, and there have also been a few times when I have lowered it to 25%. But mostly I keep it at 50%. I keep my Macbook's screen at 100% brightness. So I like a bright screen. But the 50% brightness on the iPad is really bright to me. The only exception is if there is a game and it has a really dark scene. Then maybe I want to turn up the brightness a bit, or maybe I want to dim the lights in the room. It depends on the game.However, most of the time, people are not going to have a bare iPad if they are thinking about protecting it against dropping it. Usually they will have AppleCare+ or some type of protection plan. Mine went right into my case as soon as I got the case. So with the case on it, I really do not feel any heat. The heat I was mentioning was when I was playing games on it when it was bare, before I got a case for it.Also, if you've never had an iPad, I learned from Apple tech support you can only have 11 pages of apps on the iPad (you can have unlimited apps stored on iTunes or in iCloud). But you can put apps in folders. So at least there is that option!All I can say is, if you've never had an iPad and you're on the fence, this is a beautiful device. I'm extremely happy with mine. The only thing I would wish for is more storage. I got the 64GB but it still feels like for things like photos, videos and movies that I would like more storage.The iPad third generation is amazing: you won't regret your purchase. I'm thrilled with mine.

For reading I still prefer my kindle but the iPad can do so much more. I luv, luv it & can't wait to get my iPod touch. I am still learning to use it though.

446	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	I love this thing! I have wrestled with myself on spending so much on a tablet but believe me this new iPad is worth every penny I paid for it!  I have had absolutely no problems with mine and I dont think I could live without it now. So if you guys are looking at the new iPad and trying to justify spending so much on a tablet, do it, you will be so happy!	
447	4	4	4	0	4	2	2	2	4	0	3	4	Lamen terms please!!! Okay, first of all I have read through about 10 customer reviews of this new iPad 3rd Gen. I must say that I am very impressed at some of these "editorial like reviews". Well after all of the technical stuff, I'd like to just keep it plain and simple.I never owned an iPad before last week. I was always saying that Apple was overrated and actually they're not. I have owned all kinds of "other" cellphones, smartphone and tablets. Well, last month I finally brokedown and purchased an iPhone 4S and now this cool looking iPad 3rd gen 32GB. I will just say that it makes my Samsung Galaxy Tab look pretty lame and boring. I had ordered mine online and could not wait for it to arrive earlier this week. Well anyway, I opened it up registered it on iTunes and began to sync it to my account. Well after that I began to mess around with everything and had so much fun doing so, that I didn't go to bed until really late. I was impressed that it was fully charged up when I turned it on for the first time. The graphics are second to nothing elso out. I purchased some Beats by Dre Studio headphones so I could listen to music and movies in quiet places. I love everything about the new iPad...I really don't even need a regular desktop anymore. I have considered buying an iMac desktop maybe later on down the road. I heard that some people complained about the iPad getting hotter than normal on one side, well mine has not so far, I assume Apple fixed the problem with that.Now, on the flip-side of the coin, I must say this new iPad is really heavy and dense like, I am turned off from that aspect, especially since a lot of reviews say the iPad 2 is much lighter, why is this one so heavy!? Secondly, I think this model should have an sD card reader and at least one USB 2.0 port. Lastly, I think they should have added Siri to this new iPad since she's such a hit with the iPhone 4S.Well hopefully this review is pretty simple to absorb and can be really helpful to someone. All and all, I really enjoy my "new iPad", but the last things I mentioned above is the reason why I gave it an 8/10 or equally 4/5 stars rating.**Forgot to mention**, iTunes is really cool and now they have the iCloud feature. So what ever you decide to download it will automatically appear in other Apple devices that you have registered. I currently own 2 other devices and it's nice not to have to download everything via the computer, with iCloud it's already there.**UPDATE**  9/22/12 A few days ago, I was able to update my iPad 3rd Generation to iOS 6 (so this means "Ms. Siri" is now available on this generation of iPads). I said thank you, they have answered our prayers. One strange thing that happens when you update your operating system is the YouTube App disappears...IDK what that's about.	
448	4	0	4	4	0	4	1	3	2	4	2	4	Not new iPad. The iPad was advertised as new in sealed pkg. the item was not in a SEALED package andthe back side was scuffed from sliding around a counter. this was my obversation	
449	4	4	4	0	4	2	3	2	2	1	4	4	ipad. ok we shop all over looking for an ipad from ebay to kmart the price is cheaper than anyone else for this and anyone who  knows ipad knows there amazing and it is deliver to your door	
450	4	4	4	0	3	4	4	4	1	1	4	4	Buying from Amazon. The product is excellent and meets all my Granddaughter's needs.I am writing the review to comment upon the appalling service from Amazon. This purchase was charged to my credit card. Unfortunately we managed to purchase 2 and the one I bought was returned to Amazon. Amazon they gave a gift voucher to my daughter in law for the net of returns amount. I gave instructions to credit my credit but this was ignored. Hopeless admin from Amazon!	
451	0	2	4	4	4	0	4	2	4	3	0	4	Literally a Headache. This thing is killing me.  The pixel density is so great that it is using my retinas to saw my brain apart.  It is now that I can recall when Apple put those 300x cd drives in everything and the cd's shattered and filled everyone with shrapnel.  I'm starting to think that the kindle's etch-a-sketch technology will yield a much more comfortable high "pixel" density.  If I can't return this thing and get my money back I'm pretty sure I'll go blind.  if you don't believe me, try an ipod retina display.	
452	3	0	3	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	Love it! I received my iPad 3 recently. Having never had one ths is my first.  I read all the reviews, over and over.  Finally decided to go ahead and buy.  I amm so happy with  my ipad3!  I only have 2 complaints...... #1..... It should come with a manual to help you learn how to use it.  I have an iPhone 4 and thought it would be like that....it is not.  #2..... I cannot use message the way I do on the iPhone....and I did sign up for the data plan. I called Apple to find out why it does not operate the same as the iPhone.  I will probably cancel the data plan before my month is up. Unless someone can give me a reason to keep it.Other than these 2 issues I am happy with the ipad3.	
453	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	2	0	2	2	2	Not an Apple fan. I am not an Apple fan.  I got this Pad because I am a fan of the idea of "cloud" computing.  Basically I really like the idea of having minimal processor/memory on the machine.  Was hoping that Google's chrome book would catch on and I could skip the whole iPad thing but that hasn't happened.  As Stephen Colbert jokes you can't argue with the markets so I decided to get one.  I know Apple isn't listening but if I could improve the machine I would have a mouse option included, have a slightly larger (not smaller) screen model and try to make it work more as a computer and less as big phone- I really don't like opening websites and having them come up as the mobile version.  I'm keeping the iPad but it something better comes out(MS Surface?)or if a cloud net-book catches on this thing is going to my wife.	
454	4	3	4	4	0	2	0	2	4	0	4	4	Good to have for Kindle, "webbing" and emailing. This is my first Apple product, so it's been a voyage of adventure...PROSBuild quality and ergonomics are first rate - a truly high quality product.The Retina display screen is exceptionally sharp and clear when compared to a friend's "iPad 2".Relatively crash proof and simple to operate (once the "operations code" is broken)Choice of applications is truly mindbending, likely the best feature of the unitSeamless updating and syncing with iTunesCONSApple's thought processes and symbology are different from PC developers, so there has been a learning curve for moi...  I can move around and activate any feature on any Windows PC without a hitch...  Apple has its own way of doing business...iPad "multitasking" is brain dead compared to Windows machines, and the inability to use Flash based websites due to the Apple/Adobe feud is asinine.  Fortunately, an app named iSwifter allows Flash based content to play on the iPad, so all is not totally lost, but iSwifter is not particularly user friendly.Recharging time seems to be long, compared to an ASUS netbook and a pair of HP laptops I haveAm unable to charge the iPad via the PC-to-iPad USBHaving problems updating apps via the iPad... have to update on my PC, then sync with the iPad...  minor annoyanceHas a proprietary power/docking connector, but converter cables to HDMI or USB are available.I enjoy using the iPad for webbing and email access nearly anywhere, plus the apps that figuratively and literally make the iPad sing.  Not new to an Apple-phile, but is really great for a newbie.Overall, am glad I purchased the iPad, and look forward to learning more about how it runs best...6 MONTH UPDATE - Upgraded from 4 to 5 stars. Am more comfortable using the Apple operating system and the logic they use to drive the machine... The problem with uploading apps disappeared with an OS update, now works seamlessly.  Using it most for Kindle reader or accessing email without having to boot my laptop or desktop PC.  Glad I purchased it....

456	3	4	2	4	2	4	4	4	2	4	3	3	Great---but still not quite ready to be amazing. Tablets are, arguably, luxury toys for rich people. They are cool toys, but the truth is tablets aren't yet QUITE as amazing as they need to be to fully justify their price and status.The screen. Let's take the glass half empty view. A 9.7 inch screen is still a small screen compared with a laptop or desktop. Only the prevalence of smarphones allows us to perceive it as big. Ten years ago what would people have said about an amazing computer---with a big 9.7 inch screen! And it costs more than many desktops! And 264 pixels per inch is record breaking for a medium/small screen screen but it's still low compared with almost all modern smartphones. So its screen lacks the size of a desktop or laptop screen and it lacks the extreme clarity of a smartphone screen. You COULD argue it's the worst of both worlds.If and when tablets move to 300 pixels per inch, they will be truly amazing, mind blowing, earth shattering devices. Ultra clarity like a smartphone but much more size! Such devices might be so amazing that they cause smartphones to go extinct.In the meantime, while the new iPad is a major step in the right direction, it's still not quite ready--like a Thanksgiving turkey that was taken out of the oven just a bit too early.	
457	0	4	4	4	3	2	2	1	0	3	0	4	iPad New Generation. I haven't had my iPad that long and I've already had to send it in to Apple to be repaired.	
458	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	3	0	1	4	4	Apple iPad MD328LLA. This has been an excellent investment as my first tablet. So glad I took the risk in buying the iPad an not one of those cheaper models. It is everything it is hyped up to be and much more.	
459	4	3	4	4	4	0	2	0	2	0	4	4	New generation iPad - a worthy investment. I received this as a gift first part of November.  I have not owned any Apple products before but this is a nice experience for me.  I have had no issues with it operating at all.  The battery life is good and picture quality is great.  I now use Facetime with my kids who are in college out of state and it just works and works well, even in low light.  One thing that would be nice to have corrected in this IOS is to be able to minimize a program without having to close it.  This is a problem when I want to check another program and go back to the one that was opened.  I always have to restart the program again which is a pain if I was on a certain page.  Other than that, this device picks up wireless signals very well.  Even when they show a weak signal on another device the signal strength on the iPad is better.  If you want the tablet that all others try to emulate, you will not be disappointed with this one.	
460	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	Was expecting the latest but didn't get it. I intentionally did not order the iPad 2 because I wanted the latest and greatest.  I came to find out that a newer version (with the lightning connector) was available but that is not what I got.  Needless to say, I was somewhat disappointed.	
461	0	4	4	3	0	2	0	2	2	1	0	0	Beware of fakes and scams. (Note: when I ordered this product, the title did not include the text "3rd generation".  the model number MD329LL/A is a fourth generation iPad (iPad with Retina display) as the technical specs make clear.)Important!  a 4th generation iPad has a narrow "Lightning" connector with 4 pins, not the 31 pin connector of older iPads.  This is the only obvious *external* difference between a 4th generation iPad and earlier models!  The other differences, like the "Retina Display", resolution of cameras, and speed of the CPU, are less obvious.  There are no markings on the outside of the box that would let you tell the difference between third and fourth generation iPads (e.g. no "third generation" or "Retina Display").If you have an iPad, the best way to tell which one you have is by looking at the model number displayed by the iPad software under Settings --> General.  Or look up the model number, written on the (physcial) back of your iPad, at [...] (Amazon won't let me include the URL, but a google search on "Identifying iPad models - Support - Apple" will turn it up as the first entry at Apple support.)Anyway, here's my story:I tried to order this product, a 4th generation iPad (with Retina display) from two different sellers, but received 3rd generation iPads both times.  I'm giving this one star because of the ordering problems, not the product (I hope that folks are more likely to read this if I put it down as a negative review rather than a positive one).The fist seller, "IMG Direct", sent me an obviously used 3rd generation iPad in the box of a 4th generation iPad.  The order was fulfilled by Amazon.  Amazingly, Amazon took the blame for this as a "packaging error" and voided my 2 star rating for the IMG Direct on the grounds that it was Amazon's fault(!).  I strongly suspect it was IMG Direct that supplied Amazon with the re-marked product.The second seller, "Wirelessnow", sent me a new 3rd generation iPad with the box relabelled to appear to be a 4th generation iPad.  At least it was a *new* 3rd generation iPad! (I'm planning to upload a picture of the remarked box.)I'm going to make my third attempt to order a 4th generation iPad, but this time the order will be direct with Apple!Looking through the reviews of a number of sellers, including "IMG Direct" and "Wirelessnow", i see a pattern where customers complain that they were shipped the wrong item and give a 1 star review.  Amazon then apologizes for the mistake and voids the review (the review remains readable but the 1 star score doesn't seem to count against the seller's rating!).This behavior is not limited to my two sellers -- its true of some other sellers as well!I'm going to speculate that Amazon actually pays the seller the ~$600 price for the mis-labelled item based on their "failure to fulfill it properly", so that this is a win-win situation for the seller.If the customer doesn't notice they've been shipped a cheaper product, the seller pockets the profits.  If the seller does notice and complains, Amazon takes the blame as a "fulfillment error" and gives the seller most or all of the original list price.If my speculation is correct and you're a seller, this is great!  Its a win-win situation.  Either the customer misses the substitution and you collect $100 or $200 more than the shipped product is worth, or the customer catches the substitution and Amazon takes the blame -- and you're still laughing all the way to the bank!  But I don't see why Amazon wouldn't wise up to the scam!Just my $0.02 -- YMMV (Your Milage May Vary).	
462	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	Just what the doctor ordered. Meets all expectations. Works great with my wi-fi system. Whole family uses it all the time. Would recommend it to everyone.	
463	4	0	0	4	4	4	4	1	4	0	4	4	Perfect. Highly recommend.  If you're actually reading review on Amazon of this product... do yourself a favor because you're so on the fence.... buy an Amazon Kindle Fire (much cheaper)... use it for 6 months until your upset that you can't get all the same apps from your iPhone... by that time, this model will be two generations old and you can buy it for MUCH cheaper... maybe even save money after both purchases and still have two devices to show for it.	
464	4	3	4	4	4	3	0	4	3	4	4	4	Everything I wanted. It's awesome!  It is everything I expected and more.  That's everything I have to say about that.Not sure why I have a minimum word limit :)	
465	3	0	0	4	4	3	0	0	0	1	3	4	Toy-ish. A "Paying for the name" tablet.  If your prioritary to Apple, then this is for you.  If not there are a few others that rival this item.  Arrived a bit cracked, but the packaging was excellent.  Perhaps the cold helped.  IPAD for me are more for the artsy fartsy lie, which I am.  But the cost just for a qualified "tool" of art, without the computer back up was too much for my finances.	
466	4	2	4	4	4	1	3	2	0	4	2	0	Dead on arrival, but came back to life. What more can I say?  Opened box, doesn't turn on.  Great as a book end or door stop, but not very useful as a tablet.The tablet suddenly turn on two weeks after we got it. I bought it for my daughter and she ended up giving birth a little early and didn't end up being able to deal with it.  It turned on just as she was about to box it up and send it back.	
467	4	4	4	2	4	0	4	4	4	2	4	4	I - Pad, best tablet. You can.'t go wrong with apple products.  I - Pad 3 has the new retina which really underlines Apple technology leadership.  Does it all now with crystal, clear display.  Only negative is the screen has a slight light yellow tint over the previous models.  I - Pad is very addictive.  Can't put it down.	
468	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	4	0	4	4	Just Apple! Reseña: Its everything I'm expecting for and more Like all my apple products. Es todo lo que esperaba y mas.

470	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	I like it...but. I am not sure what I was expecting. It seems to be more or less just a large iphone. This not necesssarily bad, I just thought there was more. Perhaps there is, lets give it time.

479	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	Amazingly Just As Described. I received my item within 2 days of my order, which I thought was very nice, the item is exactly as described, it is FLAWLESS with a sort of deep mark on the back, which is okay because it will always be cased anyway. I would of given it a 5 star, but I don't like the fact the I got the small charger which take 4ever to charge and I don't think that they are original APPLE PRODUCT. But so far its working good, and it was kept in exceptional condition.

485	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	0	2	4	4	I love my iPad! I got this for the whole family to share.  Everyone likes it and we haven't had any problems with it.  Out of the box I had to update some software which took about 20 minutes.  I use it for emails,an e-reader, and for watching movies/tv.  My kids use it for games, e-reader, and watching educational shows.  I was worried that the App Store would only have paid apps, but I was surprised they had some great free ones.  There were free classic books too.  I went out and bought a case for it to, but only for my own sanity since the kids were going to be using it.	
486	4	4	4	4	3	0	2	0	4	0	4	4	A superb communication device. This is my first iPad.  It is an amazing communication device.  Am also using it to brush up on my Spanish.	
487	0	4	0	4	4	3	4	0	2	4	2	4	It's OK. It's OK, but the posting does not tell me if it is 4th or 3rd generation. Anyway, it is better if it is unlocked	
488	3	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	3	4	4	4	Great. Product arrived on time and was packaged very securely.  This was my second IPad and I was just as pleased with the newer version as the older one.  I use it for everything from grocery lists, to email and web surfing.  A great tool to help keep your life more organized.  I do see people without a cover,however, I highly recommend a good cover with the magnetic turn off when closed feature.  I recommend this product.  Apple products have been a change in my technical life that is better than I even imagined.	
489	2	4	2	4	4	1	4	0	4	4	2	2	OK. Came a little later than the expected delivery dates, but that wasn't too much of a problem. I bought it refurbished and while the screen is pretty clear of blemishes, the same cannot be said for the rest of the exterior. There were scratches and signs of previous usage on the back and the corners. Did not come with the wall charger either but it did have the cable. All in all, it's in OK condition but it works and does its job.	
490	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	3	4	2	4	4	I'm very happy with this device. It works good, is helpful  and i use it very often. I would choose it a second time. Thank you.

I am experiencing the following:- The screen flickers when I am using my notes app- The screen "hangs up" when I swipe from one app to another- Sometimes the screen freezes altogether and I have to power off & on the get it moving again.If there is a way to fix these issues I would be grateful.As it stands, I am not happy with this purchase.	
500	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	0	4	1	1	A $400 disappointment. Spotty, not excellent performance. A Christmas disappointment. Problems getting VERIZON service, and the device does NOT always start up or work consistently well. This is a loser for APPLE, in my opinion. Mostly unused in my kitchen; I do not even look at it anymore.	
501	4	4	4	3	0	2	4	4	1	0	4	4	I love it. Love it. It is in very good conditions. It is very clean and it is not slow with my use.	
502	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	4	2	4	4	Very good quality. It was in a very good shape, no scratches or dents on the IPAD... And ready to use with the newest system.	
503	3	4	3	3	4	0	3	4	4	0	4	4	iPad 64GB. The iPad was much easier to set up and use than I thought it would be. The new screen is crystal clear and sharp. It is very fast and the sound is a bit better than expected. All in all the buying experiance through Amazon was good and the product lived up to it's claims.	
504	4	3	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	1	4	4	First time iPad buyer, excellent device on all counts. I decided to consolidate my digital life from my 3DS, Android Tablet and a few other gadgets into the new iPad. I ended up selling all that other stuff to pay for the $499 iPad that I bought at Best Buy. I'm typically an Android guy as I own the Droid Bionic and have only used Android phones since the original Droid. The only experience I had with iOS was with a second generation iPod touch I bought 3 to 4 years back that I enjoyed.My experience with the new iPad has been very positive. The battery life is fantastic, the screen is so enjoyable to read news articles and watch TV shows through Netflix and other streaming software. I've had two tablets before the iPad (Galaxy Tab and HP Touchpad) and iPad is the only device I've actually wanted to watch HD shows on. In almost all cases, anything I watched on my iPad seemed just as sharp and colorful as my HDTV and much sharper than my laptop screen. Top it off the device is quiet with no mechanical fans running in the background so your watching experience is really luxury stuff. I would note the external speaker is nothing special and that any type of TV or movie watching should be accompanied by a nice set of comfy headphones.iOS in many ways doesn't seem all that different at the core from when I had my 2nd gen iPod touch. It seems Apple has taken a more evolutionary approach to iOS while Google has tried to take giant leaps in user interface design. (Ice Cream Sandwich). In many ways however this has boded well for Apple. the A5X processor (pretty much the same as an A5 just optimized for  retina) tears through the menus with elegance and smoothness unlike anything in the market. That type of smoothness in transitions creates an experience where you stop caring about the clockspeeds and dual cores and ram and just concentrate on what you're doing which eases my techy brain into a calm state.I wanted to also note that the heating "problem" people seem to have doesnt' bother me. I rarely heats up and when it does it's just a tad warm nothing more. I recently put it in leather-ish case for protection reasons that seems to have reduced the heat on my hands as well. The battery charge time isn't a big deal to me because I charge my devices overnight and the slight change in heft is laughable as my last tablet (HP Touchpad) was a blimp in comparison.Ultimately to sum it up, the screen has made this device superior in many ways to almost every device I have in my apartment. It's THE screen to use when watching video and reading and it's super sharp and clear. The software support on iOS is the best of the best and the slick transitions make this a great device for almost anybody wants a great computing device when in bed, on the couch or on the go. Highly recommended.

Please check Apple's prices, which include free shipping (but tax is extra) against prices offered on Amazon before making your buying decision.  Usually Amazon has the most competitive pricing around, but for some reason they (or their vendors) are charging higher than "list price" for the various "new" iPads. WIth iPods, in contrast, they charge significantly lower prices. _Also be aware that Amazon Market vendor return policies are set by vendors INDIVIDUALLY not by Amazon._ Amazon generally has the most liberal return policies in the industry except for Costco, while individual retailers are generally much more strict.Here is my usage history with iDevices:I fell in love with the iPod Touch, 3rd generation, in 2009 when I bought it to see if it could really replace a netbook on my trips. I was dubious that a 3.5" screen would "work" but the emergence of mobile-optimized websites coupled with "double tap to perfectly zoom to full column size" feature made it workable for reading the NY TImes and practically everything else. I read several novels on this during my trips, even though the 3rd gen did NOT have the current high resolution Retina feature.When the "Retina Display" 4th generation iPod Touch came out in 2010, it was a revelation in terms of reduced eyestrain. With my contact lenses out, or with high diopter (2.75) reading glasses, I could read comfortably for hours, and the built-in illumination was wonderful, no need for a miners headlamp when going to bed, no screen glare.I wasn't sure about the iPad when it came out, and skipped the first generation. I personally even skipped the second generation (iPad2) but bought one for my wife. She has a specific, limited consumption need - she watches foreign language videos on YouTube and on a foreign language subscription website. For those two purposes, the iPad2 screen was superb, and like the iPhone and iPod Touches it has a wide viewing angle, IPS screen - compared to my laptops and netbooks, viewing angles were a breeze. With my laptops and netbooks, I couldn't shift my head up or down, I had to find the perfect "tilt" angle so the bottom and top of the screen were evenly bright and not washed out or black. With i-devices,  viewing angles are superb, colors are great - and this is true for all of them to date (with the latest "new" iPad being rated by one monitor-specific site as approaching professional quality for accuracy of colors and illumination levels). My wife could watch her iPad2 from almost any angle.But guess what? I was expecting to start to glom onto her iPad2 until it would be like a fight over the tv remote, but that never happened. I watched large video on my desktop, I read blogs and news and books on my iPod Touch! When I tried reading on the iPad2, I found the resolution was too low - it was like sliding back to a 3rd generation iPod Touch in terms of quality. Not easy on the eyes. Good compared to a netbook screen, but not as good as a Kindle e-reader (not the Fire) or as good as a 4th gen iPod Touch.When the "new" iPad came out, I knew it would be game-changing, with a ultra sharp "type." Now that I've had it for several months, I believe it is. But is it essential?I have been switching back and forth between my "new" iPad and my wife's iPad2 over the past few months, and undoubtedly the new iPad is a MUCH more pleasant "reading" experience. THIS is the best e-reader on the market - do the math - it is in COLOR so highlight colors, chapter headings, book covers, illustrations, all POP, while the text is as easy to read as on an e-ink reader, PLUS illumination is BUILT-IN. THIS is the wave of e-readers of the future.Reading email and Facebook is easier too.All icons are sharper.VIDEO IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. Remember, the iPad2 could already display 720p. Bumping up to 1080p on the new iPad doesn't provide significantly better video. GAMING IS BETTER because the smarter game programmers are using the extra video horsepower for better action and shading NOT for higher resolution per se. The new video chip in the new iPad is simply head and shoulders better than in the prior iPad2 even if the actual processor is the same speed (the cpu vs. the gpu).So why do I find my self using my iPod Touch and desktop MUCH more than the new iPad or the iPad2?Simply, size. 10.1" is a little heavy to hold. When I am reading a book where the book design is important, the new iPad is terrific. But that is rare. Most of my reading is "just text" and the 3.5" screen of the iPod Touch is more than adequate for that - long ago I got used to frequent page flipping, it doesn't bother me anymore.So what is my shopping recommendation?If you aren't satisfied with your "smartphone" (it's too small, but that is in the process of changing, already in the Android market and soon in the iPhone world) you may well be happy with an iPad. If you are mainly watching video, the iPad2, still in production, has much better battery life (they just improved the battery life by moving to a smaller "die size" for the processor/gpu - check Anandtech for the details) and fine video. If you mainly read email, blogs, and browse the web, and ESPECIALLY if you plan on reading a lot of books, don't think twice, buy the new iPad.But be forewarned that rumors are flying that Apple is releasing a 7.85" tablet soon, probably with the same resolution as the iPad2 (which means sharper letters since the screen is smaller), and that may be the "sweet spot" in terms of size that a lot of us have been waiting for. Also, rumors are flying that Apple intends to "upsize" the iPod Touch and also the iPhone to a 3.95"/4.01' screen, which will make it easier to read while still being light and comfortable in the hand.Finally, Apple devices have done remarkably well at holding their value, and Amazon has an excellent re-purchase program for small electronics, and pays some of the industries highest prices for used i-devices. There probably isn't a more significant "game changing" electronic gizmo in the last decade than the iPhone and iPad. You won't go wrong or regret an iPad purchase, and except for slightly shorter battery life there is no _negative_ to purchasing the latest and greatest - the price didn't even go up this round (although the iPad2 in 16gb only was retained).16gb is enough for photos and books. 32gb or larger is recommended if you intend to load up a lot of games, download movies or a lot of music, or take a lot of videos.

Apple can say what they want but as a keen follower of Apple I can tell you the reason they're calling this the ipad and not ipad 3 is not what they want you to think. There are very few improvements over the ipad 2. If you have never had an ipad, then go for the ipad 3. If you have an ipad 2 like I did, I would say stick with it and wait for the next year's ipad. Let me nonetheless talk about how I use this device.What do I use my iPad for -a) I stepped on my Kindle four months back and have been using my ipad for "reading" since. It is a much better experience because of the backlight, the smooth transitioning of fonts. It is so easy for me to send myself an ebook. I simply attach the .epub file to an email and send it to myself and it opens within seconds on iBook. On the other hand, if I have a .mobi file - I can simply open it using the Kindle app. If the Kindle app is installed on your ipad, when you click on the attached .mobi file in your email it simply opens it in Kindle.b) I sometimes like to watch mp4 files on my ipad. I do this when I'm lying on the bed leaning on a couple of cushions I can simply place the ipad on my stomach holding it with a hand and watch an episode of Game of Thrones. Bear in mind, it will not play any avi files or divx files and Apple iOS devices support only mp4. If you have a mac, I recommend a s/w called "smartconverter" which specifically converts avi files to mp4 for iPad 3.c) I'm using a Speck case so the fact that this little man heats up more than the predecessor hardly makes a difference. Does it heat up? yes, sometimes, it gets very annoying and does definitely heat up more than the ipad 2.d) Portable mp3. If you switch the screen on the ipad off and let it play music for you, it will keep playing at a sufficient volume for hours. I often go to sleep on my couch with the iPad singing away for hours. It can play audio for several hours without losing the battery.  I am disappointed in saying the audio is the exact same as it was on the ipad 2, so it not Louder than the ipad 2.e) Checking email, facebook, the web browsing still needs improvement because often times I have found Safari a bit lacking and buggy but trust me I am saying this from the point of view of someone who's been using the iPad for a year. If you have never used an iPad you will find it sufficient, I just find it annoying when I'm trying to use it on forums. The world wide web is still not very iPad friendly. Is it better to serve than any other tablet? Hell yes. But is it as good as using Firefox on my macbook air? Never. The keyboard is great.WHAT HAS CHANGED FROM THE IPAD 2 -a) A bit heavier but I got over that soon.b) The graphics are slightly better. The retina display is not that different. Brightness is the same.c) The 5 megapixel camera is very bad for indoor shooting. I havent traveled that much with my ipad so I can't say if the camera is all that good outdoors.d) This heats, that didnte) The battery is the same. I thought this will give me a much better battery because the battery is thicker, turns out, the battery is thicker to support the RETINA display.f) Faster graphical processor .. making it overall the fastest ipad.4G iPad - I feel all of this technology behind ipads supporting 4g is actually very misleading. In what you will really use your ipad for you will never need 4g. I urge you not to fall and become prey to ill effects of consumerism. I strongly advocate purchasing the wifi model. Even if you do get 4G and want to watch Netflix video, you get a limited data limit so why would you do that to your money?**Pulse application is good. Youtube looks the same but the newest OS has made it buggy and sometimes you have reload a video. Very amateur mistakes by Apple.I should have stuck with my ipad 2. This is really the iPad 2s. Facebook app is good. I wish Apple would charge us five bucks more and include one of those white headphones. Do buy a case if you're buying the new iPad because if you drop this it is more likely to crack the screen. Stay away from big cases, buy something practical, be a little careful and avoid those screen protectors. There is no excuse to making such a good looking device cheesy. Though it's a good reader, bear in mind, you will need to charge it daily. I turn it to aeroplane mood when Im reading but I'm not sure how much battery that saves.RETINA DISPLAY - If you put the ipad 2 and ipad 3 side by side you will notice the ipad 3 icons seems to be more clear and seem to take less space, seem more organized. It is a slight increase in the dots per inch. The hue on the buttons and icons for the ipad 2 is MISSING from the ipad 3. The new ipad does have a better display guaranteed. Here's a funny thing to consider. When I stopped looking at my ipad 2 and playing with it, I thought a month after using the ipad 3, the ipad 2 would look a little cheesy. The same way my ipod touch looked cheesy compared to the new ipod touch. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. The ipad 2 still holds its own. All said and done, gotta love the iPad.Do I use a case? Yes. Speck. It is a must have and somehow camouflages both the heat and weight.	
507	2	4	0	4	0	1	3	1	4	3	2	4	Not a notebook or desktop. Pros: excellent color. Lighter than a desktop or notebook.Cons: Cannot print except to limited number of printers (no lasers). Does not support Adobe Flash - forget most videos. Software different than regular computer. i.e. on Amazon less choices when checking out and less info about products. Touching screen does not always work and ofter works when you do not want it to.  Mouse is more accurate and less mistakes. Still better than Kindle Fire but more expensive.	
508	3	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	2	2	4	4	Outstanding. Amazing. Beautiful. The retina display is amazing and is such a better display than the previous iPad 2. Get a 32gb if you want a sixteen. Storage is packed up fast in the sixteen 32 is enough. Get this product. If you've got the 2 it is your decision but if the owned the first iPad or haven't owned one, get this iPad. It will change the way you see a tablet.

513	4	4	0	4	0	4	4	0	1	4	4	4	It is great! I bought it three days ago and it was a second hand "like new". It is working very well, came fast and we also received a case for it as a gift. It was a good deal! We also could go to the apple store and register it under the new name. This ipad was bought two months before and we still have 11 days for getting some support online if we need to. My son is having lots of fun and we could downloud some educational games. My husband and I didn't have our turns yet. But we checked and we can access our emails. Our family is very happy!

This purchase was charged to my credit card. Unfortunately we managed to purchase 2 and the one I bought was returned to Amazon. Amazon they gave a gift voucher to my daughter in law for the net of returns amount. I gave instructions to credit my credit but this was ignored. Hopeless admin from Amazon!	
519	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	2	0	4	4	PROTECT YOUR IPAD... The new iPad is certainly a step ahead of any of it's competitors right now.  I have owned one since June and have used it almost every single day since I have gotten it.  If you take anything from this  review it is that you should invest in protecting your iPad.  I use the Zagg Invisible Shield HD and the STM Grip Case (i have reviewed both).Pros:-Portability allows you to always take it with you-Ridiculously Long Battery Life.  Apple boasts a 10 hour battery life and with brightness adjustment it could certainly last longer.-Retina Display (HD videos and apps are stunning)-Front and back Camera great for Skyping/Photos-Smart cover saves the sleep button from overuse/malfunction-Speak to type feature is there but more of a novelty feature-Great for notetaking/school-New Apps released often including free apps-Many many shortcuts make it stand out such as a quick mute feature-Notification bar is great a great way to receive facebook messages/twitter mentions*Siri to be released soon exclusively on the new iPad.*iCloud feature that I have not used at all do to slow internetCons:-Apple's touch screen keyboard is awkward and the biggest complaint i have (Docked or Split).-The built in speaker is okay but could be louder in my opinion-If overused the battery section of the iPad can be hot to the touch (can be negated with case).-May end up spending a lot on pricey apps (225,000 in App Store) so look into jailbreaking-Rear Camera is high quality but front camera not so much-Can promote carpal tunnel syndrome (Stylus can help)-No USB or SD Card slot-Limited to Skyfire Browser's Flash capabilitiesFavorite Apps by Category:Game Apps:-DreamLeague (Soccer app)-Peggle HD-Words With Friends HD-Fruit Ninja HDSocial Apps:-Facebook-Twitter-SkypeBrowsers:-Skyfire Browser (For Flash Videos)-Safari is my go to browser otherwise-Have heard Chrome is fast but have not tried itStreaming Apps:-Netflix-Amazon Instant Video-WatchESPNMiscellaneous Apps:-Alien Blue (Reddit)-Notability (Taking Notes with a stylus)-iBooks (Reading books you can get for free off the internet ;) )Lastly, SHORTCUTS.  The new iPad has many shortcuts such as swiping with 4 fingers to switch between apps or quickly adjust brightness.  Look into all the shortcuts that the new iPad features so you do not have to slowly learn them on your own like i did.****If you have any questions or comments i would love to hear it****	
520	4	4	4	3	3	3	0	4	4	1	4	4	Best tablet ever. The new iPad has a gorgeous screen with a superb resolution I don't use my laptop anymore for browsing purposes, the ease of use and the smoothness of the UI is unbeatable, I purchased an incipio NGP back protector and is great. Apple is the most valuable company in history for a reason.	
521	0	4	4	4	4	0	3	0	3	4	0	4	Literally a Headache. This thing is killing me.  The pixel density is so great that it is using my retinas to saw my brain apart.  It is now that I can recall when Apple put those 300x cd drives in everything and the cd's shattered and filled everyone with shrapnel.  I'm starting to think that the kindle's etch-a-sketch technology will yield a much more comfortable high "pixel" density.  If I can't return this thing and get my money back I'm pretty sure I'll go blind.  if you don't believe me, try an ipod retina display.	
522	1	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	1	1	1	I HATE THIS SO MUCH. Okay, im a 13 year old girl. I have saved up all of my xmas money for an ipad, I am one of 4 kids, so we all pitched in to buy one for our family to share. The first thing i noticed was that the web browsing is hilarious. The magnifying glass is so retarted, i hate how it automatically corrects you. The camera is a joke, the apps are a million bucks, updates take a minimal of 3 hours, my imessages dissapear. The facetime is a pain to set up, my screen is green, i cant watch a video on it without it skipping, i dropped it (because my sister thought it would be oh so funny to drop a hot skillet on my foot, but my dropping it is not apples fault. They cant help it shattered) the app store is so stupid, the notes are plain, the email is sometimes not recieved, no flash player, you cant do home work on it, over all...... Go buy a new car and 4 other computers instead of this. The only reason its not gettin one star is because there is a crack over the first star.	
523	3	3	4	4	4	3	4	0	3	4	4	4	Best Apple Ipad Ever! This Apple Ipad first generation is perfect for people who have kids. As a child with four siblings, I know this is true.  It is only about a few centimeters thick and can contain all the games you love, your calendar, the internet, and so much more. It isn't too small so that you can't read anything on it, but it isn't too big so you can take it places.  You can download games for the kids and have your apps also. My mom and dad will use the Ipad when they need to look something up or check the calendar. I love to play card games and watch movies on Netflix. Everyone in my family has their own app that they can always go on.  The only downside is how the internet connection is set up. My older siblings and I like to go on the internet to check our emails and facebooks. On the ipad first generation you can't get on the internet unless you have wifi. When we are on road trips we can't see what our friends are up to.  The people who wouldn't like this product would be people who need internet connection everywhere they go. That's alright because there is another ipad for that, but for me the Apple Ipad first generation is perfect for me.	
524	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	0	4	2	4	4	Awesome. What can I say that hasn't already been said. This thing goes everywhere with me.  The display is unbelievable and the 4g wireless is faster than heck.  Photos and video are so beautiful.  If I mistakenly leave it at home, I go through serious withdrawal!!! I use it for business as well as personal use.  Highly recommended purchase	
525	1	3	3	4	4	4	4	0	3	4	1	1	Most of 64GB Memory Unusable.  Buy the 16 GB Model if any. From the time the iPad was first introduced, customers have been complaining about the "Other" category arbitrarily expanding to consume the available memory.  To date, Apple has never explained this problem or made any effort to fix it.  I have never been able to load more than half the iPad before the "Other" category suddenly appears and swallows most of the remaining memory.  I have the 64 GB iPod Touch and it easily loads all my stuff in under 50GB.  The iPad can't load half of it in "64GB".MANY customers have been complaining about this problem for YEARS and many have offered solutions on community forums, none of which work.  Apple remains silent.  It takes 10-20 hours to load the iPad depending on how many times you have to restart iTunes, which is frequently.  Since August 8th when I started counting (exactly two months now) I've tried to reload mine 33 times.  That's right:  33 times!  I tried many more times before I started counting.  I've gotten used to glitchy and unstable software from Apple, but Apple has been ignoring people's pleas for assistance with this problem for years now.  I'd hoped they'd make some effort with iOS 6, but NO help at all.  The 64GB iPad is a rip-off since half the memory is unusable.  I recommend not buying more than the 16GB version and just using it for basic games and simple email.If I only wanted 16GB, I'd say the iPad works fine.  It's way over-priced for what little you can do with it and I suspect most users would be happier with a small notebook computer that actually functions.	
526	4	4	3	3	3	0	4	2	4	0	4	4	good product. this came reallly well and works perfectly , arrived on time and came with no damages , the only thing i dont like is that the ipad 3 came without headphnes -_-	
527	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	3	3	So far, so good. I am not an Apple lover. I wanted to get a tablet PC due to the portability and convenience. Family and friends use and like the iPad. They speak highly of it, therefore, I decided to try out the iPad as opposed to the Samsung Galaxy Note.Things I like: The iPad is light, convenient, the screen resolution is great. It is pretty easy to use, connects with wireless sites with ease and no hassle, the battery life is great.Things I dont like: There is no "arrow key" to move the cursor backward, forward, up or down to position the cursor where you want it to correct spelling or add words. The backspace "key" is the only way to move the cursor and it erases characters. The touch screen allows you to place the cursor where you want it, but it isn't always responsive to my attempts to place the cursor where I want it; so this too can be awkward for making corrections etc. I ordered a stylus. I hope the stylus will make this a little more tolerable. Bookmarks are weird. I have used Safari. Chrome, Yahoo Axis and none handle bookmarks very well. I suppose it is something I need to get used to.	
528	4	3	4	4	3	0	2	4	1	0	4	4	Solid performer compared to all Tablets. After owning the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 which died after 8 days, I went back to buying the latest iPad and haven't looked back.  The problem with Android OS is the instability (constant crashing) and poor battery life.  Apple knows what keeps users satisfied by not trying to throw every possible piece of crap technology known to mankind.  They keep what works and only implement what makes sense.	
529	3	3	3	4	4	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	Exceeds Expectations. I purchased this iPad for my wife, her first pad-style system.  She had had an HP laptop, and was never very happy with it.  The iPad is amazing, and I also purchased a case with an optional keyboard, but she actually prefers the screen keyboard.  To say she is happy with the iPad is an understatement.  She loves it!  And being an Apple product, everything is better than advertised.  She loves the graphics, and is already Skyping with her brother.  So we could not be happier with the product.

OK I feel sorry to all of those who were cheated through Verizon or other means.But there is nothing wrong with the product itself; it is just the service/places consumers got them from.Yes, machines/electronics cannot be perfect, but we are getting there.I would say I got more than 500 bucks out of this; so many advantages.Do not feel the need to list them all; best experienced through an actual use of it.	
531	4	3	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	0	4	4	Love it. I love the ipad! It is the best you can get buy it it is worth it ......... Nice nice

534	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	1	4	4	Love Love Love it. Best thing I have purchased so far I use it every day I use it for everything and take it everywhere oh did I say I love it well I Love it	
535	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	0	4	3	3	3	IPAD 4. good product but a bit overhyped.no instructions - you are expected to know what to do (I didn't since it wass my first apple product).The Samsung Galaxy would be a better value.	
536	4	4	4	3	4	4	1	4	1	3	4	4	iPad 3rd gen. Fantastic ! Easy to learn, very fast and love the screen size. Also, tech support was A+. This was my first apple purchase and I am totally happy.	
537	3	4	4	3	4	0	4	3	0	0	4	4	iPad 3rd generation. It's my first iPad. The product is exactly what the online specifications showed. I am quite pleased with it. Also got a great bargain on it.	
538	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	3	1	1	4	4	Apple wins again. I love that i can take my library with me,my bible study tools with me and fits easily into my purse.I wanted a bigger size than the mini and love it, the ease with which apple products work is amazing, compared to android. I will always choose apple over any other.	
539	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	0	0	Save yourselves!  Buy something else! I bought my iPad about three months ago on the recommendation of someone working at a store that wasn't associated with Amazon.com, but I feel I must warn the rest of the world to keep away from this arrogant piece of <word I shouldn't use in an Amazon review>.Unless you get up and start your day by kneeling at your personal shrine to the Holy Trinity of Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs, and Steve Jobs, then spend twenty minutes beseeching the Holy Spirit of Saint Steven's Ego, don't come near this thing.Lots of people will tell you what it does, let me take a few minutes to tell you what it WON'T.Multitask.  Playing a video or audio file in one window or tab?  Don't look at anything else!  As soon as you do, 99% of the time your playback or whatever stops.  And, if you switch back, the very idea that it might hold onto that data seems to be a foreign concept.  Download a 200 meg PDF file, read thirty or forty pages, then check your email.  Coming back to that tab leads to your iPad basically saying, "Oh, you weren't done with that?  Well, we'll just have to re-download the whole thing from scratch!  And, even though it would be incredibly simple for me to do it, I didn't bother to remember where you were at."Flash, Java, and JavaScript. "Why would you want to play anything like that?  Stephen Christ did not approve of such heresy!!  Therefore, you do not, either.  Therefore, you have no need to see them, use them, or have me acknowledge their existence on websites.  I shall block them out and make popup windows of large, empty frames to protect you from their sinful natures.  Praise Steve!!"And before anybody replies and says that you can eat apps that will run flash movies, yes, those do exist.  However, either you have to pay a monthly subscription fee for them or you have to become the software equivalent of an AMWAY distributor to keep using them.Wi-Fi vs cell connection.  I purposely bought the model of iPad that had a cell connection, and, unlike a number of other reviewers, I haven't yet had any trouble with that cell connection and I do like the navigation software, but, given that Wi-Fi is generally free and cellular data generally costs money, wouldn't it be somewhat reasonable to default to using the Wi-Fi if there's a connection available?  Or have a place where I can set a preferred order to access these things in?  Oh, not in Blessed Saint Steve's world!  I have to turn my cell connection completely off anytime I'm using wi-fi, or it'll just keep pulling data over the cell.This damn touch keyboard.  Enough has been said about that in other places, but let me assure you, it's true.Keeping the screen clean.  If you're using programs that require you to input a lot of stuff or you're typing a lot, be prepared to clean your screen off every twenty to thirty minutes.  I just use a paper towel that I always have sitting by my iPad, so that's not too bad.  It's still an annoyance, though.Finally, how reflective this screen is.  Working against a white background isn't bad, but if the background is darker?  Well, looking straight into the iPad screen is like standing eighteen inches away from a mirror and trying to watch a t.v. program being shown on the glass.  Maybe this is supposed to be some kind of symbol that Blessed Saint Steve, Hope For All Mankind. Is watching over us, I don't know.  What I do know is it's annoying as hell.I could go on, but I think I've made my point.I'm just hoping that, when my financial situation improves to be able to replace this embarrassment to progress, I'll be able to borrow a hunting rifle from a friend of mine, and, with five or six rounds, put this iPad out of my misery.Who knows?  Maybe I'll film it and put it online.(In QuickTime, of course, so all of Saint Steve's worshippers are allowed to see it.)	
540	4	4	4	4	2	1	3	3	0	2	4	4	I Pad 3rd Gen. Performs as expected.  Big improvement over the 1st generation.  This might be the best camera we have out of 5.	
541	4	4	3	3	4	0	3	4	4	2	4	4	Love it! I love my ipad. Can't stand to be without it. The best thing since sliced bread. Entertaining and so much fun	
542	1	0	1	1	0	0	4	3	1	2	1	1	Returned to Electrobrands. Item was determined to be an old version and no longer needed, therefore I contacted the shipper and returned it.	
543	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	2	2	3	4	4	REALLY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. I bought this tablet for my lil sister. She loves it.I purchased it a few months ago, was waiting for my sister's feedback in order to write a review, and as previously stated she loves her ipad.I am also satisfied as the purchaser....	
544	3	4	4	0	3	3	1	4	2	4	4	4	same as 4. is the same retina, same all just conector is different so i recomend this over the 4 or the mini the mini is very light but no retina!	
545	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	1	4	0	4	4	excelente producto. lo recomiendo ampliamente, para un uso mas profesional, le recomendaria un teclado bluetooth, yo le compré el zaggs, muy bueno y robusto	
546	4	4	3	4	4	4	2	1	3	1	4	4	Awesome. It's an iPad with retina display. Nothing more needs to be said. I use it everyday, no issues whatsoever. Battery life is awesome, speed is amazing.	
547	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	2	0	4	3	4	good condition. very happy with the iPad. it was in the condition that said it was in. i like very much when sellers are straight with there grading	
548	4	3	4	0	4	4	1	0	1	1	4	4	First I-Pad I have owned.  Seems Great to Me! I really don't have anything to compare this to.  Thought it would be more of a novelty item really since I have a computer, but I do find I am using it more and more because it is convenient to pick up and search the web for something, or play a game, watch a movie, play music.  Haven't had a bit a problem really except getting dropped from my wireless connection.  Seems if I reboot my modem that usually solves the problem for a while	
549	4	0	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	1	1	1	No something I wanted. Returned it and bought kendle fire much cheaper and has everything I need. Too expensive for me. Hope u will finally accept this review	
550	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	4	4	Great and more space for itune downloads. The touch Screen is clear and colors are bright with no issue of any hick ups or stalling.Easy to download applications where eve your can find a wifi connection and its light weight and easy to move around with.	
551	1	4	0	4	4	4	0	4	0	4	3	3	It is a very user friendly device. The only reason that I gave it a 4 star, is because being accostumed to the Windows environment I like flexibility and expandability.  The only way you can put more memory in this thing is by buying a more expensive model, really?	
552	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	3	4	4	Better then I expected. Just received my used ipad 3 and it was like new with no scratches, dents, or cracks. It was only the ipad and charger and it was will package. The only problem I had was the shipping from FedEx. They never showed up to my house and would report as I was not home when I was so I requested that it be held at a fedex location. I was a little nervous that I would receive the wrong ipad but ezcorp sent the right one.	
553	4	4	3	3	4	0	3	3	4	0	3	4	I like it. I am still finding out things about it.  Have to wait for my grandkids (7 & 8) come back to help me.  I am not computer literate.  It is fun and I am enjoying it, but am still confused about what to do sometimes.	
554	0	4	3	4	0	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	THIS SUCKS. I BOUGHT THIS ITEM THREE DAYS AGO AND I RECIVED IT TODAY. I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING A GOOD PRODUCT, IT WAS SAVERLEY SCRATCHED ON THE SCREEN, THE SIDES AND BACK WERE FULL OF DINTS AND NO BOOK FOR IT OR CHARGER. I  WILL NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN.	
555	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	Changes the way you do everything! I've had my 3rd generation iPad for a little over a year now. This device joins my very first iPod and Kindle on my "Why didn't I buy this sooner?" list.When the iPad first came out, I knew I wanted one. I didn't know what I would use it for, I just knew that I wanted it. I loved my iPhone so why wouldn't I like this?I had no idea. The iPad changed everything. I am still amazed by all of the things I can do with it. Here the list of how I use my iPad on a daily basis:* Email - Obviously. I use it for both work and personal email, especially at home after work.* Web browsing - Naturally. The Safari browser (as well as the Google Chrome app) work great. As long as there is no Flash, it's as good as or better than using a computer.* Reading - The Kindle app looks amazing on the Retina screen. Plus, since I can sync what I'm reading between this, my iPhone, and my actual Kindle, it doesn't matter which device I have with me, I can always pick up exactly where I left off.* Magazines - I never read a ton of magazines before, but now the only ones I do read are in the Newsstand app. Just like with books, I've gone paperless here.* Comics - I'm not a huge comic fan, but there are many titles that I do like to read. The key there is "read." I don't need to collect them anymore. They just take up too much space. I just want to read them and move on. Now that all of the major publishers have excellent digital versions of the comics (most released the same day as print) it was a no-brainer to go digital here. As soon as I got my iPad, I stopped buying paper comics and have been 100% digital ever since. That has also saved me money. Most digital comics are cheaper than print (some the day they are released, some a few weeks later). I'm usually so far behind in my reading that the price has dropped by the time I'm ready to buy the next issue. In just one year, I have saved almost half the cost of the iPad by waiting for comic prices to drop before I purchase. I can carry 100s of comics with me at any time. This is the future of the comic book industry.* Movies & TV shows - With Netflix and Amazon Prime, I can stream an endless number of TV shows and movies. Combine that with my own digital library of shows and movies and I never have a shortage of something to watch, no matter where I am. The best accessory for my iPad to watch movies is my hammock in the back yard. Can't be beat.* Sports - I'm a baseball fan so I use the MLB At Bat app to watch games of my favorite teams. (subscription required). The Watch ESPN app is great also.* Social media - Facebook, Twitter, etc. In many cases, their apps are better than the user interface you get in a web browser.* Shopping - The Amazon and eBay apps are way better than their standard web interface. The last few times I've sold something on eBay, I created the listing 100% on the iPad (including the photo).* Games - Everything from basic puzzle games, to social games, to platform-quality action games can be played on the iPad. I used to play more video games (consoles, PC, etc.) but don't have as much time for it anymore. Now if I have 10-15 minutes free, I can jump in and play some Modern Combat 4 no matter where I am.* Notes - Almost three years ago, I decided to go paperless with my notes at work. My handwriting was horrible and I can type faster than I write. I started using Evernote and haven't looked back (actually, I'm typing this in Evernote). I've learned that I can type pretty quickly on the iPad keyboard so that is all I take to meetings these days and I have access to all of my notes.* Connecting with friends/family - With Facetime and Skype, it's easier than ever to fire up a video chat.* Remote desktop - There are several apps that allow you to log in and remotely control your PC/Mac from the iPad. This means that you don't have to carry all of that with you.* All the rest... - Dropbox for file sharing. Countless games and TV shows for kids. Online banking. Pandora for some music (combined with a Jambox you get a lot of music and great sound). The list goes on.So there you go. If you aren't sure what you'd actually use an iPad for, hopefully this will help you see the potential. I used to sit with my laptop on my lap when hanging out at home. Now I keep the iPad around and can grab it quickly and easily to do just about anything I need.	
556	0	4	4	3	0	4	3	3	4	0	0	0	Save your money. No support from Apple or the seller for product. Do not buy this product from Amazon. Apple will not service or replace it because someone has messed with the insides. Mine has completely died and no one will do anything about it. A major rip off. The company who sells it through Amazon says that it can only be returned within 30 days. It begs the question, who messed with the machine and why. Save your money and go to an Apple store.	
557	4	3	4	4	4	3	0	1	3	3	4	4	Fantastic Ipad. Its just what I wanted.  Excellent shape - no scratches.  Looks like new.  Fast delivery and it was just what the description said it would be	
558	3	4	0	4	3	0	0	4	4	4	3	3	It does everything! I use my ipad for everything. It has pretty much become my new computer. I gave it 4 stars though, because it'll randomly shut off while I'm in the middle of something. I don't know if that has something to do with the OS or just the one I have. I guess like every tech gadget, it doesn't work 100% of the time, only 99%.	
559	2	2	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	0	4	4	great deal. It was a brand new tablet like I wanted The price was fair I would recommend anybody to shop with Amazon	
560	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	4	4	1	4	4	Great gift. I got this iPad as a gift when i first came out and it is still working perfectly. I haven't had a problem with it yet and it is truly a nice piece of hardware. One of the only issues I can point out is the rear facing speaker, but there are ways to fix that.	
561	4	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	1	4	4	a great purchase for me. Beautiful!!  No problems.  Works like a dream.  Very happy with this purchase.  Continuing to keep me satisfied.  Will continure to shop here.	
562	3	4	3	3	4	0	3	4	4	0	4	4	AI like the Kindle better but the ipad works great. I really like this tablet, yet, it is not as easy to use as my Kindle..Company I dealt with was wonderful and helpful.	
563	2	3	4	4	3	4	4	0	3	4	1	1	I was misled. This ipad was advertised as new but is not. Not only did it not come in the box but it has a nick in the edge. I kept it because being used is ok but this ipad was advertised as new.	
564	4	4	4	3	3	0	2	4	1	0	0	0	SOLD ME A PRODUCT THAT WAS DEFECTED AND OUT OF WARRANTY!!!!!!! I purchased an apple ipad 3 generation .....THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NEW!  This is a demo model that was stuck in demo mode and WAS OUT OF THE ONE YEAR WARRANT WITH APPLE...the only option was to pay an additional $300.00 for apple to fix it on top of the 500.00 I GAVE Universal Media Sales to buy it!!!!!  It will not let me do anything!  I have contacted the seller...we will see what they do about this issue!  I am so upset right now I cannot even say!  Lesson learned!	
565	0	0	4	1	4	4	4	3	1	4	0	0	Cracked screen after 3 weeks of minimal use without any form of abuse to the product. Within 3 weeks of moderate use (and handling with carefulness) the screen cracked and shattered at the top where you turn on and off.  This was not dropped or abused in any way.  Thankfully Amazon stood behind this purchase.  Again, this cracked with out dropage or any misuse.  I don't believe this was at the fault in any way of the shipper, but after further research appears to be an Apple issue.	
566	3	3	3	3	4	4	0	3	3	1	3	4	Happy with iPad. This is our first iPad. The new Air is 3 or 4 hundred dollars more than this one was. I think this one is very good buy for the money.	
567	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	0	0	0	4	4	Love it! I got this for my bf and he loves it!! It was kind of a bummer it didn't come in its original box but nonetheless a great gift.

570	3	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	1	4	4	Apple ipad. 3rd gen. excellent cond., recommend taking class or buy instruction book, would recommend to any one interested in going to an ipad.	
571	4	4	1	3	4	4	1	0	2	2	4	4	got this a year and a half ago and still have it and use it. what more is there to say... it's an ipad.  It came on time, it still works, and it has enough space for everything I do with it (light music comp in garageband, browsing, photos/videos, and watching netflix and other streaming services).  I'm confident in a few years it'll still be available to pass down to my son when he turns 4-5 for drawing and playing educational games.	
572	3	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	Still using the Ipad. The retina screen looks beautiful and clear. Im still using the ipad now and reading and watching videos on it has been great. Its a little heavy and the charging takes a little long. Will wait to see how the new Ipad looks like this year. The price on this listing is a little expensive for something thats like 3 years old.	
573	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	0	3	4	The only option for aviation apps. I bought my iPad 3 for using aviation apps in my airplane. The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.	
574	4	3	4	3	4	0	4	2	2	4	4	4	I love it. Love it. It is in very good conditions. It is very clean and it is not slow with my use.	
575	4	3	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	3	It is a good ipad. I bought it to my friend and my friend likes it. It's useful, but a big problem is that it doesn't support extra storage	
576	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	4	0	4	4	4	thank's. wooow!! all i can say is the best and the fastest ever.i love it.very good condition.i will recommend it to all the amazon buyer. .AAAAA++++ seller.great seller.great product.clean.hope to buy soon another one.	
577	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	4	4	4	3	3	Great Upgrade, but not quite as expected. The new iPad is very nice, but it really isn't that great of an upgrade compared to the iPad 2. The screen is really nice and sure you get a better camera with a faster processor, but there isn't enough content yet to justify spending the money on the new iPad. The content that isn't Retina Display enabled tend to look bad when compared to Retina Display enabled content. It's great, but I would wait for the next one.	
578	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	2	3	2	4	4	New iPad. This has been the best investment no more carrying my Mac around, and the quality of the supplier outstanding, prompt delivery and perfect condition of the product in properly packed box. I could rave on and on but enough said well worth the price	
579	4	4	4	0	3	3	2	3	4	4	4	4	OWNED IPAD 1, 2 AND NOW 3. No long review or repeat of specs here...Weight and size are virtually unnoticeable although its a bit thicker.....Fits in the original iPad 1 case. I've used this case for all three iPads....It does run a bit hot....  Processor is faster.. Screen is very very clear....Still slow battery charge and NO FLASH player.... I would not have purchased iPad 3 but the company I work for gives us points to spend each quarter and had enough points to purchase this iPad....It's really quite nice.....iPad 2 resale is a no brainer.  Just tell everyone at work you want to sell your iPad...It takes about a day.  eReaders are for old folks (because they actually know how to read) nothing compares to an iPad.  Other tablets are just wanna be's......I have enjoyed owning iPad...I use it with a Verizon Samsung 4g LTE.... at Dr's appt.'s, at lunch, during break time, at work.....They slowly keep getting better and better..	
580	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	1	4	3	4	4	Amazing Ipad!! My son is very happy with his new Ipad, we was dreaming with this device for two years at least, this Ipad will help him in his university studies	
581	4	4	4	3	3	1	3	4	4	4	4	4	as advertised. Works great and is everything that was promised. suprised at how long the battery lasts....take the time to look at the instructional video's and learn all of the movements and options if you are not an Apple person.	
582	3	3	4	4	0	2	0	2	4	4	4	4	Love It!!! I bought this for my 54 yr old husband who is "TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGED". He struggles with texting on his cell phone...for heavens sake! If there is any kind of problem with computers, phones or internet, I have to figure it out.I bought this tablet for him and he absolutely loves it! A chimpanzee can use it. There are no user manuals that he has to read...just turn it on. He carries it everywhere.I researched pricing and Amazon.com was the best deal by far PLUS it arrived in 3 days! Amazing! I would highly recommend the IPAD for anyone who gets overwhelmed with technology and even for grandparents (it has skype)! It is worth the money!	
583	4	4	0	4	3	4	4	2	4	4	0	2	WiFi issues. Had my iPad 3 for probably 6 months, having bought the first and second generation ones previously.  The WiFi got slower and slower.  Had Verizon out to my home for 1/2 a day - they checked everything.  Ipad worked fine for another month then WiFi slowed to a crawl.  My wife's Ipad 2 continues to have no WiFi problems. This appears to be a problem with iOS6 - it is well documented at the large company I work for.  No more Apple products for me.	
584	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	2	0	0	DO NOT BUY THE VERIZON IPAD. I haven't had any problems with my iPad EXCEPT for deactivating my VERIZON account.  This product is advertised as allowing you to sign-up for service one month, drop the service when you don't need it, and then reactivate the service when you want it again.  DON'T BELIEVE IT!I used the Verizon service for one month, deactivated and received the message that my sim card is associated with another account or is no longer supported.  When I updated to the new IOS 6, the sim card was magically reactivated (!) and I could use the service again.  I signed up for a month's service again and at the end of that month's service, I deactivated and received the same non-service alert.All Apple forums on this problem have the same complaints.  Consumers need a new sim card and are hassled at the Verizon store to change service.  As far as I am concerned, this is false advertising so I have filed a complaint with the FCC as recommended in the Apple forum.  I am waiting for a call from Verizon before proceeding with replacing the sim card.  If I need to constantly replace a sim card then that should be stated in the advertising.The reason I purchased the new iPad was to be able to use it and pay for ONLY the months I WANTED and NEEDED, not for what Verizon wanted to sell me.  I am extremely disappointed with both Verizon for the service and Apple for allowing this to happen.  This is not how this product is promoted by both companies.If you want the new iPad, maybe you should try AT&T; instead of Verizon - maybe they have better service - maybe not!  Research it.	
585	4	3	0	0	4	2	3	4	4	4	4	4	Verizon prepaid data plan information. This is my second iPad mainly because I wanted to upgrade to the Retina display and have a 4G cellular connection.  (I have no complaints about either iPad - they're very useful devices and deserve 5 stars.)  Because I had talked with Verizon customer service before purchase, I knew I wanted the prepaid option and ability to suspend auto-payments.The rep's advice was to open a separate email account for the iPad (I used a free gmail address).  I was told there have been problems with AOL accounts in particular.  I was also warned NOT to delete the account or phone number when I wanted to stop auto-pay because that would necessitate a replacement of the SIM card.  He said I could uncheck the auto-pay option in the cell account settings on the iPad.  With that information, I found registration was painless and fast.I used the iPad on a long west coast car trip, accessing the Internet in the car for 3-4 hours a day.  As always, Verizon's coverage was good and fast.  I found that 2-gigs of data were enough for web surfing, checking email and GPS work.  I let the plan auto-renew so I'd have enough data for the last few days of the three-week trip.When I returned home, I wanted to suspend the auto-pay so I went searching for the 'turn-off' option on the iPad.  No luck.  I called Verizon and the rep quickly deleted the auto-pay feature from my account.  She also told me about that option on the iPad but when she looked for it on the iPad 3, couldn't find it either.I plan to use the Verizon access intermittently over the next year, so here's what she told me to do to make sure I wasn't receiving unauthorized charges:  Call Verizon to stop auto-pay (800-786-8419), then re-enter credit card information and choose a plan when I want to restart.  She said there was no problem in calling them for cancellation as many times as I wanted.Seems clunky to me and I don't understand why I can't manage the account from the iPad, but at least Verizon is responsive and helpful.  If I was a bit more of a skeptic, I'd theorize that Verizon makes the deactivation a bit murky in the hopes that users will let the plan roll over rather than call.

587	4	1	3	0	4	4	2	4	4	3	3	3	Apple still has a leg up... I will never, ever use an iPhone. Android has got me with their million customizations and options when it comes to mobile phones. However, when it comes to tablets, they still have a long way to go.The iPad simply is designed to teach anyone who picks it up should be able to figure out how to use it. That is great for most of the population, and for me most days. Having a program (iTunes) that allows for being able to connect to the computer can also make a big difference when you want to quickly add movies/tv shows/ Outlook data.The closed eco system that is Apple can be annoying, especially when I can customize my phone far more then my tablet, but until Android begins to unify a bit more in their tablets, I will stay with the iPad.	
588	4	4	4	4	3	0	1	1	4	2	0	3	Please read this if you think of buying: Ok, I would like to start by saying that the iPad that my wife got for me has no functional deficits. The reason I am assigning a "1 star" rating to this product is NOT because we bought a defective unit. Nor am I disappointed with the service: every time I went to the Apple Store to get help (and that happened a lot!), a perky 16-year-old would materialize out of thin air and show me how to press the only button available to make the gizmo work.But herein is the rub: if buying an iPad, any iPad, please be aware of its limitations. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A SMALL COMPUTER, WHAT I GOT WAS A LARGE CELL PHONE WITHOUT THE PHONE!PROs:-- it looks cool;-- my kids love it;-- yes, there are a lot of free apps in the AppStore;-- you can check your eMail pretty much anywhere and any timeCONs:-- many "free" iPad apps are "teasers;" i.e. they have limited functions and you have to pay to get a full version of these apps only to discover that they are often faulty;-- NO Java support-- NO Flash media support (although the iPad does come with a free YouTube app)-- NO preloaded apps that would let you manage Word-type documents or Excell-type spread sheets (you have to buy those but, again, once you do, you soon realize that they are nowhere close to the quality of the ones you use on your desktop [Mac or Windows])-- most importantly, there is NO ABILITY TO MANAGE YOUR OWN FILES! This one particular lacking feature drives me to distraction! There are several apps you can BUY that would allow you to manage your OWN files but, again, they are very poorly designed and often do not interact well with iTunes, Windows, or, surprisingly, iPad's own OS system .-- and here is another critical issue: EVERYTHING MUST BE SYNC'd via iTunes. If you are running a Windows desktop, this may be (and in my case indeed IS) a serious problem. Things purchased via iTunes, iStore, AppStore, etc, usually manage to get to your iPad unscathed. Other content (e.g. I am an eBook fan and purchase my eBooks in multiple places on the Net) are not so fortunate. Although, Apple's iBook app is free and allows you to use both .pdf and .ePub formats (you can also install a free Kindle app for .mobi books),  actually getting your books onto your iPad may be difficult, if not impossible. You cannot "drag-and-drop" your book files (or any other files) onto your iPad. Everything MUST BE SYNC'd with iTunes, an app called "DropBox," or some other app. If your iTunes does not get along with your desktop (usually a PROBLEM FOR WINDOWS users like me),  you will end up spending endless grim nights uninstalling iTunes, re-installing iTunes, wiping your iPad clean, sync'ing and re-sync'ing your iPad again, and again, and again.-- The Camera is OK, but keep in mind that all your videos will be in .mov format and may not play on all desktops --you will need a special converter to re-code the formats for non-Apple media players; you will need to install "Quick Time for Windows" on your desktop if you are running Windows.-- finally, there is noway to increase the amount of memory for the device as there is NO slot for a memory expansion card. I can't believe it! Every tablet has it BUT iPad. So you are pretty much stuck with 16 gB, 32 gB, or 64 gB tablet without ever having any hope of expanding!OVERALL :  I feel so bad that my wife spent all that money, time, and effort to get me this. I feel awful that her loving good intentions made us spend ~ $900 for something that turned out to be just an appallingly expensive toy, poorly engineered, thoughtlessly designed, and very frustrating to use. (The MSRP is ~ $600 - 700, but there are sales tax, additional warranty, front cover, back cover, USB attachments, and other apparel that one needs for this thing, hence the enormous price!)  The good thing is: it is possible to easily re-set it back to factory settings. And we still have the original box. I think it will make a great (and a VERY EXPENSIVE) Christmas gift for my in-laws. For Windows users (like me): please, think hard before sinking all that money into this purchase! Again, keep in mind, this is NOT a small and portable computer, IT IS ESSENTIALLY A SmartPhone WITHOUT THE PHONE!... just a bit bigger, though...

593	0	0	3	4	0	0	4	4	2	4	1	1	Poor wi fi performance and customer service. My IPAD 3 wi fi constantly slows down or loses connectivity after fifteen minutes in public wi fi spots. It does well at home.  In hotspots it's unusable.  I went twice to the apple store and a genius did a reset of wi fi networks, went out to test, no better, returned and requested an exchange as its still under warranty. The manager said their "process"requires a total system reset first.  So they reset it and I had to leave.  Still no good.Contrast this with customer service with Verizon where I had a defective earphone jack on a droid phone.  They took my word for it, shipped a new phone out immediately and a container to return the old phone.  You bet I will stay with them.My next tablet will be an Android.  Apple no longer has a monopoly on tablets which seems to elude them.A also have a Kindle Fire HD which is great.  I will have to make a third trip to the Apple store which is not convenient.After my third trip to the Apple store, they honored the warranty and gave me a new and working iPad 3.  I must say, the apps for the iPad work very well  give it an edge for now.	
594	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Very good. Got this for a friend and she loves it so much. Thank you very much, I am a happy customer.	
595	4	3	3	4	0	2	3	4	4	4	4	4	Its very good. Hello. Everything arrived fine. I would like to know about the warranty. I live in Venezuela, and the ipad work with 3g  any carrier. Which is fine	
596	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	I LOVE THIS! I'm still not totally sure what to do with this...but I love being able to pick it up and search for something that I just heard or seen.  My husband says it is a $500 Game Boy for me...and that is somewhat true...but am trying to use it for more useful things!  Still love it anyway!

599	4	4	2	4	0	4	4	2	4	0	1	1	Over heats. Wasn't pleased with the product I received.  I usually purchase direct from apple, but the price led me in this direction.  I should have known that hen something is too good to be true it usually is a poor decision.  Buy direct is my advise.	
600	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	1	4	4	Happy Birthday. My son had to have an Ipad for school, so we ordered this one refurbished from an Amazon dealer.  It arrived quickly and in good repair.  He has not put it down since it arrived.

602	4	4	4	3	4	2	4	4	4	3	4	4	Wonderful Tablet. I purchased the 3rd Gen version after seeing it used in other places. I didn't have to have the latest and greatest and this serves me well just fine. Waiting on the iOS 7 update to come out soon. Works great as a hot spot also when needed.	
603	0	0	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	2	4	Its Apple It does what it says on the Tin! Does what you expect with min fuss.  Its Apple after all.  Many other have written about issues and features etc.  I am only saying that on Prime delivery and when it was Tax free - This was a cost effective way to purchase - Now Amazon are playing on a level field, they are not lower cost anymore!	
604	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	4	1	4	4	Great alternative for an expensive GPS and in general just nice device. I use mine in a portfolio case for work and then in a LifeProof waterproof case for use in an offroad vehicle for GPS with no phone signal. Make s a huge GPS display much larger than even very expensive Lowrance or similar systems. Use RAM mounts for any mounting needed. Many apps for GPS ... works great deep in the forest. Fair battery life.

After very little use for 52 days beyond warranty, during watching a video the sound stopped. I called support and went through a hard reset but still it did not work. I took it to the apple repair shop and I was told that this is a common problem with the ipad 2 and 3 and that the loud speaker has to be changed for the cost of $78.57 plus tax.I was vwery disappointed because I always believed that Apple did a good job with quality and did not expect this from them. If Apple had  a problem it had to recall or at least replace at no cost.	
606	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	2	4	4	iPad 3rd generation, 32G. My only disappointment is how extremely delicate this iPad is, and how I wish I had purchased a better case to protect it around my kids! It survived one drop to the floor, but the screen cracked a bit on the corner, and now I have a Military protective case on it for life!	
607	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	Perfect. This works perfectly. It was bought for a friend and he always appreciate it. It is a  nice buy. thanks	
608	4	4	0	4	3	1	0	1	4	1	3	3	iPad is good...priced too high for having scratch/crack in screen. I understand that this was refurbished, but screen came with a crack/scratch about 2 inches long.  I called company and could never get through.  They must work same hours and me.  They did call back and leave a message, but didn't say much about what they could do.The iPad does work, but has to be rebooted often because it starts running slow.  Still trying to figure out if it is an internet connection issue or the iPad.  Internet Provider says it is not them.	
609	0	0	1	4	0	0	4	4	4	2	0	0	Ipad3 64gb w/4g, the sound stops working after 1.5 years daily use. I bought the Ipad3 w/4g when it released. I paid $900(including tax). After 1.5 years daily use, the sound stopped working. I took it to the apple store for genius bar. After 40mins inspection, the tech told me it is the hardware issues, if I want to replace the speaker, I have to pay $299.  They can't fix it in the store. Really? It is almost the cost to pay for a new ipad. Then he told me I can trade it in on the apple website, that would be the best solution. I never heard about this, then I asked him to show me where to find it on the apple website. He couldn't find it, and then he went to the back to ask someone. 5mins later, he returned to tell me there is no trade-in on the apple website. OK, this is the quality of an apple store tech. Of course my ipad is broken after the warranty expired, because it is not made to last. Apple can't wait to release a new ipad every year so that they can get money from your wallet. I thought their product was good quality. Not anymore, it doesn't last.	
610	0	3	4	3	4	4	1	4	1	4	0	4	Great device -one star for apple support for itunes  -ATT data plans. Be sure the Itunes 10.7 or later software is loaded on your computer and works before you buy this.I could not get it to work and APPLE tech support would not help. They foolishly (IMO) said theyonly support Apple. DUH.,.there was an error message...and all that was needed (I think) was to deletea file in the folder the error message gave. YOU would THINK Apple tech support could have helped.Not to worry Hewlett Packard Tech support got me up and running. Thank goodness I have a new PC and under warranty.The ONE star is for a COMPANY that WILL not support their product on a PC.I just spent $659 on an apple product and smart cover with Houston slaes tax.THAT is the very last dime APPLE will see from me. As a new customer to APPLE I was appalled.NOW the reason to use Itunes is A) to buy them online...and B) to be able to backup your device.You do not have to be able to use the software on another device (like a pc or mac)..it is a safety feature.Also be careful syncing..because you can wipe out all IPAD data. Make sure the IPAD controls the data.I love my new ipad mini...I got the smart cover and highly recommend.The camera feature was great.I installed dropbox so I can access my travel documents.Things I learned:When buying these IPADs..first of all if you want one asap..you need to go with 32 MB or LARGER.The 16MPB go quickly.Then you have to DECIDE which IPAD to buy the unit configured with A data plan provider or none (wifi only).That can be AT&T;, Sprint, Verison. AGAIN...check the data plans offered because you can buy them separately from regular plan.AND you are stuck with the data plan provider.I got AT&T...and; wanted to use it for my trip this week to Mexico.AT&T; refused to sell me international data service until I had a data planfor three months. I am not a happy camper.AHA..not to worry.THAT restriction is ONLY if you call AT&T; and prebill contract for two years.If you buy the service yourslef month to month you CAN add international immediately.At least right now!You can buy from ipad mini...or online<...>you first MUST buy a data plan..and THEN you can immediately purchase an international plan.AND you can start the international plan any date up to one year in advance.It starts midnight eatsern time on day you select.I just picked the day before to be sure I had service AND you can log in and change the international date.And if you CANCEL att domestic plan..if you do they charge domestic data to international data or something. Read the terms and conditions.The att ipad domestic plans are month to month...you have to cancel 7 days in advance. They say they bill two hours in advance.RIGHT NOW...if you exceed your data..they do not bill you for more..your plans just stops until the next autorenew date. That is awesome!. Phew. However you can go online and add more time. Thischanges to a new 30 day period. Data does not roll (bummer).They allegedly have a non-autobill option for doesmetic. I could not figure it out.They give your device a cell data number for billing.International does NOT autobill.Use this address to view your iPad Data Account.<...>If you already have data you can use the email address / password on the right side to log in.If you don't have data you can use the Sign Up For Service button.There is not a lot of information on the page, so not sure if it will fit your needs or not.You can show the credit card information used on the account under the Edit User & Payment information page.I got the Ipad mini unit asap in person..on BLACK Friday...so I could get the unit immediately...and buy one with a data provider.Be careful in your choice of data provider.Love the ipad mini. It is much better than the Kindle Fire for travel/web access and photos.It has a camera and with dropbox, it automatically backs up pictures online, etc.I can share folders with friends using dropbox.The unit is small enough to take with.Battery lasts fine (8 hours) and the smart cover shuts it on and (sleep mode).I did have problems because I oops kept failing to fully plug it in. Make sure the usb is fully engaged.You do not have to turn unit off...just put it in sleep mode..uses very little battery.However it charges BEST when the unit is off.FYI-It does NOT use a jump drive.  Mini has the tiny "lightening" port.I suggest dropbox on a big pc rather than hacking it...and reformatting the jump drive.Someone said they got jump drive to work using a camera attachment.I just wanted a small device for traveling, taking pictures of my rental car, checking in online to get boarding passes.However...I can  use it at home and sit out by pool or in the living room...and it is kind of cool.I'm new to these devices...I love it. Not so much Apple support.And AT&T; is very very very hard to find IPAD info. Use links above.YOu can set up plan from your device....but I had trouble and had to go through a live person.Using the links I gave you can check your usage online.Once they make international sims with the NANO chip, of course you can get your own international data plan through them.Be very careful with your ipad mini sim.In summary:check to see if you can load latest itunes on a pc or mac first. (optional)check to see what data provider you want. (optional)you may need to get a larger unit 32 or 64 if you want one right away.for att...go to att.com.ipadlanding to see data pllans for ipad.	
611	4	4	0	2	2	3	4	4	2	4	4	4	Christmas gift and it will be throughly enjoyed. We have one of the larger units and it was always being borrowed. This smaller unit is full of new features.	
612	4	4	4	3	0	0	4	0	0	3	2	0	Good product but easily broken. My first Ipad purchased was a black 32 mg mini.  I bought it at the Apple store because it cost much less than here and my name was engraved free.  I really like this mini. I can put it in my handbag and take it with me without needing a big bag to put it in.  I purchased the leather case sold on amazon to go with it as the magnetic case from apple is not much good.  Pretty useless actually.I am glad I waited on this mini as downloads and playing games going to FB or wherever is so easy.  I gave this a five because I really like this product.Update:OK, so I dropped it on the floor.  I go to apple care and they say it is under warranty but I really didn't buy that at all. And I was right.  Here are the steps for repair.  You try and navigate the apple care site, get a repair id, take the ipad to UPS Store and they wrap it and send it overnight to Apple.  Apple gets it and says, oh it is damaged with a cracked screen and you must pay $241.77 for us to repair.  I say ok.  I go online and pay the $241.77 to repair the glass.  They send another email a couple days later and say we didn't hear from you so we shipped it back unrepaired.  I call apple care.  They say, we see the emails and the payment we don't know what happened but let me connect you to a supervisor who can suggest a couple things.  After being on the phone 20 minutes with them they have the dude call me back and he says, I don't think I can intercept the ipad but if you will send it back we will repair it.  I said look, I already had to drive 10 miles to a UPS store and paid $241.77 only to be told it was returned unrepaired. There was no solution offered to me only that I could call this manager back.  I said for what.  You had your chance and I am disgruntled with apple and expected a whole lot more from Apple.  The moral to this story is forget their repair center.  IT STINKS!  I understand my town has a company that repairs for the same amount with a two hour wait.  That would have been a lot easier.	
613	4	4	4	3	3	4	0	1	4	4	4	1	Merchants Price Gouge. If you pay more then $329, for a 16 GB and WiFi only, YOU ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF. Apple fixed the price for every retailer at $329	
614	4	3	4	4	0	3	1	4	4	0	4	4	Great product; fast ship; would buy from this seller again. Purchased an I Pad mini for my wife for Christmas.  Been an "Apple" person since 1984 [first Mac computer].  Cannot beat the quality and performance of an Apple "anything"!  Mini arrived safe, secure and fast.  Would buy from this seller anytime.	
615	4	4	3	4	2	4	1	4	1	1	3	4	light & wide screen. I love this ipad mini despite it has not the retina display or a faster processor. It is light, slim and nice comfortable screen. The best device available for reading purposes. I guess the white color is better as the black is sensitive to finger prints.	
616	4	4	4	3	3	4	2	4	4	1	3	4	Mini iPad with Maxi Features. This "mini" iPad is no baby brother in the family.  It delivers the same visual quality and accessibility as those that came before it.  The price is right and you can carry it anywhere.	
617	4	3	0	4	3	1	4	1	4	4	4	4	Traded my iPad 2 for my iPad mini with no regrets! An older friend of mine wanted a "pad" she calls it so we both made a deal that I would sell mine to her at a discounted rate and she would give me enough for a mini so that's what we did! I don't regret it! I love my mini! I use it everyday and to me since I've been simplifying my life for the last year or so this was a great investment for me because "Less is More"! I can do everything on my mini as I did on my iPad 2 with no problems! No regrets at all! No complaints here! :)	
618	0	2	4	4	4	4	3	3	0	4	3	4	LOVE IT! But buy it at the store because its CHEAPER! First of all, this is cheaper at the apple store, even Walmart has it for the same price as the apple store, so if you want this please save yourself some money and buy elsewhere!I don't know where to begin, I guess I should say I am using my iPad Mini to type this review and I find it easy to use to type. I really love this thing, it's slim and light and in have all my apps synced to my iPhone without a problem, which makes me happy, I could not do that on my kindle fire.I love the apple operating system, it's always smooth and just flat out works well.Being said that I have an iPhone(4S) I am a little disappointed the mini doesn't have the crisp retina display, but I'm sure it would be a bit more expensive if it did, and it is already a bit overpriced to begin with. But if you use it to organize your life like I do, the price for a smooth running system is well worth it. I'm sure they will be coming out with the mini retina by march or November 2013, I might upgrade when the 3rd gen. comes out and let my husband or my kid have this oneI LOVE APPLE :-)	
619	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	A perfect product. I purchased this item as a gift and it was perfect. A great product between the iPod and iPad, perfect picture, perfect size, and again, a perfect product.	
620	3	4	4	4	3	0	2	2	2	4	4	4	Great Product but the wrong gift. The iPad mini is great but I had to return it.  The gift request was for the new iPad 3.	
621	4	4	3	4	4	3	1	4	4	4	3	4	Another great Apple Product... iPad mini is great. It's just a little to small. I have both, the mini and the New iPad 4. I would go with the 4 if I could only have one.	
622	3	3	0	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	We had to exchange this. The Mini is a great size! But unfortunately, this one didn't work. It couldn't hold on to a WiFi signal. Apple exchanged it, but it was disappointing on Christmas Day. It was no fault of the seller. We heard that a lot of the first Minis didn't work.	
623	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	Great! Everything I expected!! Love the mini! Arrived just in time for my birthday gift for myself! Five stars for sure!	
624	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	1	4	4	4	4	Light, Thin and easy to read, a great product. The best facebook and email product.. 1000s of apps that work, easy to use and did I say everything works right out of the box.	
625	2	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	I love this tablet. This is an amazing tablet/computer. It's so light and the thinnest tablet I've ever seen. 7.9 inches may seem small on your computer screen, but it's actually a decent size. And light and small enough to hold in only one hand. It's perfect for typing papers with Pages. But I do recommend buying a BlueTooth keyboard, which is what I am using now to type this review. Watching movies is awesome. And games from the App Store are so fun to play. The only down side is that it's not as clear as the full size iPad. But that really isn't a big deal unless you're super crazy about that kind of stuff. Otherwise I highly recommend this tablet to anyone looking for something like this. I hope you decide to buy one, it'll be worth the money.	
626	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	1	1	4	4	3	Great Tech, Screen a Bit Small for My Aging Eyes. The iPad Mini is a great tablet - it gets 5 stars, but it's probably more like 4 stars for me because my eyes just do not like the smaller screens any more.  I actually traded my mini to someone for an iPad 3 which suits my purposes better.  If you need the portability and don't mind the smaller screen, it's convenience and performance are great.  I'd just recommend seeing it in person and using both size tablets (and Retina vs. regular display) to see which suits you best.	
627	4	4	4	3	4	4	1	0	2	4	4	4	comment. small, light and good-looking,also very useful!White is much better.I use it to read books and surf internet, and also play games.	
628	4	2	4	4	4	0	4	0	4	4	4	4	Women's iPad. I bought this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loved it! She tried to use the regular iPad but its 10' screen was too big for her purse. The look and feel of it made it to a perfect companion, being small, beautiful and very useful. It was also a success with our kids that would rather play the games on a smaller device that is friendlier than the big 3rd generation iPad they used to borrow from me.	
629	4	4	1	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	Love it.  Hubby learning to use it. Very happy with the product purchased for my hubby.  He is learning to use it.  Very user friendly for some who isn't computer savvy.	
630	4	4	4	3	0	4	0	0	2	4	4	4	LOVE! I love the Ipad mini! I am not technologically advanced at all, but this has already won my heart! I never wanted anything apple until after grad school, just as a reward for hard work. Luckily, A few peers and I are studying abroad and the professors recommended this product or a kindle. Thus, my apple award came sooner than I would have thought. ENJOY!	
631	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	1	4	4	4	Excellent Product. I bought this for my wife who always wanted to use my IPad3.  This has been a great addition and meets the needs for her and the apps that she uses.  In the evening I can now use my IPad.

633	4	4	3	4	0	2	1	4	4	1	3	4	My initial experience. I had a poor experience with the initial start up.  When I called the number on the one sheet " user guide "the "support" person was no help,  made me wait for someone who was to know something.  His main interest was in selling me a $165.00 support package.  I didn't buy!!  All I wanted was someone to help me past the opening screen.  I have family help that achieved that.  I love the actual iPad though.  The key board is small for my fat fingers but that is no fault of the iPad.	
634	4	0	3	2	4	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	what's not to love? Received my Apple iPad Mini late last week. The learning curve, even for someone who is not a computer nerd, turned out to be fairly short. There are some features still to learn but I'm now up and running quite happily (even wrote a blog post). I added a case and peripherals since I'm an avid photographer and also a writer who wants to be able to use the mini for editing and writing while traveling or cafe-ing. I purchased the Logitech Ultrathin keyboard and the UXWrite app (uses Word and Dropbox to work between computer and iPad). Also, for photo downloading: Apple Lightening readers for memory cards and camera direct. If you only take pics with your iPad or iPhone you don't need this. Since the nearest Apple store is 280 miles round trip I researched and ordered everything through Amazon and it was all efficient and quick. And, oh yes, it fits in a medium-sized handbag!	
635	4	3	0	3	4	1	4	3	4	4	4	4	iPad Mini review. It's a nice item.  We seem to be able to replace our other brand readers and tablet with no issues at all.  I'm sure it would be a great buy for many others.	
636	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	4	4	Perfect. Good Production, I like it very much!Thank you!Sellor provided a good speed and good customor service to me.	
637	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	Perfect. Perfect. iPad came promptly, new in box, and my fiancé loves his birthday present even though he opened it a month early. Bum.	
638	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	3	3	3	Good for the elderly, but onscreen buttons are small. My mother learned to use a Windows 7 netbook machine in her 70s. However, the computer got uncomfortably warm and thus was not ideal for using in a sofa. She loves her iPad Mini. I no longer have to worry about viruses, updates rebooting the system, "your computer is too slow" errors on Skype... And a touch interface is certainly a lot more intuitive for people not too familiar with computers.A few of the bad things about this are:-Since it's small, my mother sometimes have to press several times on onscreen buttons until it activates. I guess at least for native apps they could have adjusted the size of the buttons so they remain as easy to press as in a big iPad.-No ability to download music directly to the device to the Music app... Unless you purchase it on iTunes. This is one of the biggest issues preventing iOS devices from being fully independent from computers.-No flash for the back camera-iPhone apps look ugly on it, because they don't display in iPhone 4 resolution, but it iPhone 3GS resolution (pre-retina). This means pixels have to be doubled.An unexpected bonus was:-A fully functional compass. I wish my iPod Touch had one.	
639	3	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	LOVE IT. This is the BEST gadget ever.  I use it all the time and still learning some of the features but it is FANTASTIC	
640	2	4	4	4	4	0	4	2	3	4	0	0	drop it, its gone. I've purchased several Apple products. They eventually drop. Mine dropped while I was seating, I even tried catching it on the air but a 45 cm fall was enough to assassin this glass-only device. The edges are so slim that they will bend and quickly press the glass to rupture. If you buy this, it has to be bundled with a bumper or any sort of similar protection, else, you may know its fate.	
641	4	4	4	0	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	Works on 3G overseas with local (Movistar-AR) GSM sim card! Very thin, but solid. Excellent display. I am exremely happy with it. I am using a GSM SIM card from an overseas provider and it works just fine, even though it is a Verizon pre-installed unit, it supports GSM just fine. In fact the best buy if you want to use 3G or 4G is the Verizon because it has the widest array of mobile telephony bands.Mine came preinstalled with iOs 6.02 and it is already jailbroken. Sweet!A great product. No regrets. It was not very difficult to adapt to the smaller screen, having used a regular size iPad. It is very bright and clear.Battery duration is quite good. Wi-fi is solid and no problems so far.	
642	3	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	4	0	4	4	Great alternative to regular iPad if you're on a budget. The regular iPad is great, I'm sure, but I wasn't really willing to spend $500+ on a tablet. This was much more affordable, and you get all of the same great features besides the size. Now, I know there are obviously other differences between the two, but coming from someone who isn't super tech savvy... it's basically the same. I love it! The only thing I would say isn't amazing is the sound. Sometimes it's not loud enough when I'm watching Netflix. That's it though! It's great!	
643	4	3	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	3	4	4	great product and company.... got my mini ipad a day earlier then it stated and it works great would recommend this product and this company to anyone.	
644	3	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	3	4	4	Fantastic product. Portability is a huge plus. Also, I was able to take handwritten notes for Chemistry even with the small size of the mini.  The small size did not diminish the ability to have hand written notes electronically vs real paper.  Tons of apps make the iPad my only choice for a tablet.  Wifi is great!  Great range!	
645	3	4	3	4	4	1	2	0	3	4	4	4	iPad mini. iPad mini is a great investment.  Price was a little better than in stores, ordering is easy thru Amazon and always very speedy delivery.  The iPad is extremely easy to set up and screen is vivid and easy to manage. Thank you.	
646	3	3	4	4	4	1	1	0	4	4	0	4	Not as good as I thought it would be. I was really excited about getting an I-pad mini for my birthday in August. Now, I wish my husband had purchased something else. It took about four hours for Apple to get it up and running. Four hours! I knew it wouldn't be as simple as turning on a button, but four hours is a bit much.There is a problem with this I-pad mini. I have had other difficulties with it.Another thing, no instructions came with this that even told me how to turn it on. I had to figure that out all by myself.My daughter purchased a cheaper brand, took her about one minute to set it up, and it works better than my expensive mini. Maybe for social media it's great. I don't do social media, so I really wouldn't know about that.I ordered three albums from I-tunes on it: one I was charged a dollar for. Then that was taken off my bank balance, and I still haven't been billed the correct amount. Another was supposed to have been $6.98 plus tax. It came to $17.something. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason to their pricing.Grrr!Another problem is the battery. This definitely does not hold a charge, even though I turn the device off when I'm not using it. This is just annoying, and I've decided not to use it for an e-reader. I have my Kindle,and the battery holds a charge much better. I am thinking about purchasing a kindle fire. I really can't see the I-pad mini as any kind of substitute for an e-reader or lap top.Update 1/11/2014: My I-pad mini has died. It isn't recharging at all. I deeply regret having purchased this. Other problems, when I type a comma, it switches it to an s or a totally different word! Disgusting. I don't know for sure, but I bet this was a used one sold as new. Too may problems to name here, but I will say if this is representative of an apple product, I'm not purchasing anymore apples. My Ipad mini has Itunes I've purchased. That was wasted money because now I can't use the Ipad to play them. Don't buy the mini. It's just a piece of junk!Update 2/17/2014: Took my iPad mini in. The UBS adapter was the wrong size for my mini. Also the UBS cable wires were bent. I bought a replacement for both items. Yesterday, I opened up Siri. I hadn't tried to use that before. I discovered all kinds of names in it. For instance, e-mail Shirley. Make reservations at a restaurant in Paris. It is loaded with other names and instructions. I know none of the names, and I've never even asked Siri for anything. I paid full price for a used item. grrr.	
647	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	It frees you from the computer/laptop! My husband and son love theirs.  They play art games with one another, they research, the connect with friends.  It fits nicely into the hand and is extremely portable and well-protected in the case.  We call my husband's the "electronic lady" because he cannot keep his hands off "her".  He is however, now researching more with the family for items he needs rather than in his office on the computer.	
648	4	3	4	3	3	2	3	0	0	3	4	4	Apple mini iPad. I love my mini iPad. It does everything I have to do.i mainly play games. But I also research and orders.	
649	0	4	3	3	4	1	4	4	4	1	0	0	Another used iPad Mini sold as new. I echo Reader44's review (above) about getting a supposedly new iPad Mini from Amazon that turned out to be used.  My Mini arrived on Friday with paperwork showing that it was being provided by Freebie Electronics.  I had no problem getting it configured on my wireless WiFi network Saturday morning.  I then called Verizon and provided the necessary information to connect using 3G.  However, it would not connect even though I had the Verizon logo and three bars on the screen.  I called Verizon back, and another person told me there was a "problem," and I needed to speak with the Fraud Prevention department, which was not open weekends.  Or I could go to a Verizon store and have someone there look at it.  I opted for the latter and drove to the Verizon store in Torrington, CT.  Someone there checked it out, entered some data from the Mini on her computer, and confirmed that the Mini had been previously sold to someone else.  The unit was "blacklisted" because that someone had neglected to pay his or her Verizon account.  No, Verizon won't unlock the Mini, so I have to return it to Amazon for a replacement.  Amazon's web site says Freebie Electronics gets 4.9 out of 5 stars, which seems hard to believe if that company makes a habit of providing used electronics to Amazon for sale as new.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed with Amazon. I have bought lots of stuff, not just computers, from Amazon and certainly expected better.	
650	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	2	4	4	4	4	Great little tablet. I love the light weight of this mini pad.  Easy to handle and carry.  I have the first generation iPad and it is quite heavy.  Takes great pictures .	
651	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	1	4	3	3	Okay. The iPad is ok most of the time some times it shuts down a game and goes back to the home screen but over all it's okay.	
652	4	4	0	4	3	0	2	1	4	4	4	4	Loving my ipad mini!!!! Love it!  Easy to work with and will not buy anything else after trying a Surface tablet too.  Just ordered another one for my husband.	
653	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	3	4	4	4	Great product. Purchased this for my 9 year old for his bday.  We went through 3 android tablets (cheap ones) and I decided to purchase this one and he loves it and I am loving it as well. I am more of android person and now thinking about Ipad Air.	
654	4	4	4	4	3	4	0	3	4	1	2	4	Smaller iPad - Big Whoop. It's a small iPad without Retina.  Battery lasts.  Best thing about it really is how light it is.  Cheaper than full size.  Parent's like it for travel.	
655	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	Apple iPad mini. It's your typical Apple product.  Very user friendly and intuitive, great graphics and wonderful product support.  I like the smaller size for reading online content.	
656	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	0	4	4	Best Purchase! Perfect size and works great for on the go.  Great with a Bluetooth keyboard case.  Easy setup; just turn on, tap settings and connect to WiFi and you're ready!

660	4	4	2	4	4	0	4	2	3	4	2	4	Be replaced with a new one from Apple VN. The iPad I received had been sent to VN as a gift to my friend. When she opened it, she found that the camera did not work. She finally had to contact Apple VN who agreed to exchange for another one.	
661	4	4	4	4	3	4	2	1	1	4	4	4	Love the iPad. This was given as a gift and so far i know they love it.  It's just like any other iPad	
662	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	great product. Have never owned ipad previous and after shopping around, decided it would be difficult to beat another Apple product. Really like this product. Set up and getting started was very easy. the ipad mini can do more that i expected. Features are simply great. I would definitely recommend this product. The price from Amazon was also great.	
663	3	0	4	4	4	1	4	1	4	2	3	4	My Rating. I chose the iPad mini for its convenience. I do not own a lap top, so I had to go to the desk top to go online! I can now search the web and get my mail anywhere there is wifi!	
664	0	3	3	4	4	2	4	4	2	0	3	4	great size but not enough storage. I find that I'm not using my full size iPad anymore.  The mini works much better for travel and it works find for around the house. I only wish I had splurged on the 32GB.  I've taken some pictures with my mini and I sync with my Mac so the past 12 months are on my mini.  Photos take about 3GB.  I only have 46 songs loaded. I'd rather keep everything, but I've cleared off apps that I'm not using and everything else that I can clear.  I don't have room for more than 2 rented movies. I'd like to load enough video to keep me entertained for both legs of a 4-hour flight.	
665	4	4	3	4	4	1	3	4	4	4	4	4	The 5 year old loves it! Apple has a really great product, and yeah, you might pay a bit more, but it's oh so worth it.	
666	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	2	4	4	4	4	Love. Came in fast! And works like a charm. The information given in the computer was accurate with my actual iPad thanks!	
667	3	0	4	0	0	1	4	1	4	3	4	4	Christmas present. Bought this for my mother in law.  She was thrilled.  Then they went back to Colorado, so I don't have much to report, but she hasn't called and complained.  And since she is my mother in law, no complaining is well worth it!!	
668	0	4	3	4	0	4	4	2	1	0	0	4	Ipad mini disaster. Item looks beautiful but, arrived defective it would not pick up Wifi and is typing the wrong letters. It is a piece of garbage. I truly regret purchasing this item and now I know it would have been better spending $16.00 more at Best Buy for a fully functional Ipad. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this garbage because Amazon won't back or, support you. You might as well give you $284.00 to a beggar.Eve	
669	4	4	0	4	4	1	4	1	4	4	2	4	Disappointed! It was a gift.  Arrived with no operating instructions or warranty information in the box.  Just the I-Pad.  Would not purchase from this supplier as a warranty and even the most basic instructions should have been included.

672	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	3	4	4	4	Perfect size. Everything you love about your iPhone, but much more useful for at-home time. Light, awesome battery, and the same high hardware quality of any Apple product.

675	4	0	3	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	Great gift. I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She's been using our daughter's ipad 3rd generation and she said that this ipad mini is the perfect size for her. It fits in her small purse and is easy to hold with one hand. Someone at her workplace who was considering buying a samsung tablet changed his mind when he saw her ipad mini. I was a little hesitant to order this on amazon because some people's review say that they're getting items that don't seem brand new and looking like they're pre-owned. Well, so far I never had any problems with amazon orders so I based my decision on that. When my wife opened the package, I asked her if it looked brand new and she said that it doesn't get any newer than how it looks. So the other reviews remain hearsay to me.	
676	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	0	3	4	4	Just wht the doctor ordered! I got it for my granddaughter who received an award for never missing a day of her kindergarten class.  It's a perfectly sized for her little hands and fingers.  She's very adept at it whether she's sitting, standing, laying or hanging upside down.	
677	4	3	4	4	3	1	2	4	3	1	4	4	Great product!! Wonderful device, I enjoy the ability to transfer data off of my iPhone to my iPad and the easy to carry size of the iPad mini.	
678	0	4	3	4	4	4	2	2	3	2	4	4	Don't know why I waited this long! I'm thoroughly enjoying my iPad mini.  I've used it almost as much for essential communications as I have for entertaintainment.	
679	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	IPAD. Just as described- New and works great.  I might get another one.  I got it as a gift for a family member.	
680	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	1	4	4	Great Media Toy. Not the newest iPad out but still great. With the 3G model I can get internet access when i need it!	
681	4	4	4	4	4	1	3	4	4	4	4	4	Came very fast. I highly reccomend this because of the quality, speed of shipment and the great price you would be missing out if you dont get this.	
682	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	4	2	0	4	4	great price and fast shipment. This was a gift for our daughter. It was by far the best price around. She loves it! It was shipped so fast.

684	4	4	3	0	3	1	4	3	4	2	4	4	LOVE! I got this iPad mini for my brother who is a Marine so he can Skype us and have something to do during his free time. Then I had to buy one for myself because I loved the size of the screen compared to the bigger iPads. The only thing I don't like is that there's no flash for the camera.

She was always playing games on her little iPod and would look up from playing for a long time and would have to take a little time in getting her eyes to adjust back to normal. Anyone who loves to play games on their iPhone or iPod knows that is not always the easiest. Go get a mini and games become much more fun!My sister took her mini on vacation and was taking pictures of just about everything. And when she isn't taking pictures, she is playing a game (she's actually very good!). In fact, rarely does this mini leave her presence. I think we can call this a winner!

I browse the internet, watch youtube videos, download great Free books,etc. The problems I encountered were 1) it would sometimes freeze up an I would have to press the reset button to the back 2) when searching through Aldiko for free books, the search engine would freeze and I would have to restart through all the books again. Other than those issues,the kyros is worth every dollar.

Set up my Coby Kyros 7-Inch Android 4.0 today.  Had a problem with it finding my IP address but called my provider, Verizon, and within 5 minutes was on the internet.  So far I'm very satisfied with this tablet.  I mainly wanted something smaller than my laptop to surf the web, check email and play games (my favorite being Words with Friends).  I haven't used Netflix yet but will work on that tomorrow.  The battery life seems great, too.  I charged it overnight and was playing around with it for about 4 hours and still had battery life left.  So, for my few needs for a tablet, I'm very satisfied!	
698	4	4	3	4	4	4	0	1	3	2	2	4	Good, but not perfect. It's a very good product, a would be totally satiesfied if only the accelerometer works fine, but it doest'n, so it is a little disappointing because i can't play games like asphalt 5 or others that use that hardware.

It was, without a doubt, the worst purchase I have ever made. Not only does this tablet not receive a WiFi signal but once every 2 hours (and it only lasts for 5 minutes), but it also claims that the signal is in range but protected. Even if you have the password to your WiFi, it won't connect to it.My advise? Get an iPad. I would gladly switch to Apple products after buying this 10.1 inch flashing Android paperweight. It might cost more, but remember: Less price always means less quality.	
701	4	4	4	3	3	2	0	4	4	4	3	4	Its ok. This tablet works just fine with me its kinda slow though but it serves its purpose  I wanted to search internet read books I have kindle on it ... lots of music the bad this g no fb app

703	4	4	2	3	2	4	4	2	4	3	3	3	Great for what it does, inexcusable for what it doesn't. The Coby Kyros MID7042-4 is a great, inexpensive tablet that is responsive and easy to use, but before you can use it you have to add some apps; many will find it refreshing to get an Android device without all the clutter, but some of that clutter is useful.  When you try to add apps you'll discover that without a custom ROM you can't use Google Play and you can't add any Google-specific apps, like those for Gmail or Google Reader, so you'll have to make do with what you can find on GetJar and Amazon, which is admittedly a lot to make do with, but if you have something you love on your Android phone you may have to do some digging to find it for your Kyros, if it's even available.  Some apps won't work with the Kyros or won't work well - I've spent weeks trying to get Astrid to work properly; it works, after a fashion, but I can't use the voice input or sync it with Google Tasks, so it's just short of pointless.Aside from that the Kyros is a very good tablet and a pleasure to use for watching movies or reading and for the price it's hard to beat.  [NOTE:  I wrote this after buying the tablet for about $110, not $150+]A note about shipping:My tablet arrived on the very next business day after I placed the order, even though I asked for standard shipping; there was a slight imperfection on the screen so I sent it back and got a nice note of apology and a replacement tablet within three business days!	
704	3	0	1	0	0	3	4	4	4	4	0	0	dont buy. about 5 weeks in the screen got really hot all the time.  it began to crack.you cant even get in touch with someone at amazon to let them know about it.it's my sons and now i had to spend another $100 because he was so upsetit is not working properly.  amazing how after 30 days they say there not responsible.this is why you should not buy online.  go direct to the store!!!!!!!!!!	
705	3	3	0	4	4	4	3	3	0	4	1	0	Not worth it! Sent it back!  Connection was to slow and screen to hard to pick up on finger movement. I decided to stay with and order anothe kindle fire.	
706	4	4	3	4	4	3	1	4	0	4	0	4	iIT SUCKS. I GOT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON, HE IS ALWAYS USING MY IPAD TO LOOK AT NEXFLEX SO I SAID I WOULD BY HIM A TABLET FOR CHRISTMAS.  YOU CAN'T PUT NETFLEX ON THIS IT ISN'T ENOUGH MEMORY FOR IT.	
707	4	3	4	3	3	4	4	4	1	0	2	1	Was excited about the hdmi ability ultimately disappointed. Cannot download apps to use Netflix or HULU so a bit of a waste for me. Not impressed with touchscreen either can be pretty frustrating as one moment it is responsive and the next it wont. I guess you get what you pay for.	
708	3	2	1	0	4	2	2	4	4	3	3	4	definitely has pros and cons. Pros: screen is colorful, easy to use, has usb port/micro sd card slot/micro usb portCons: unable to 'borrow' books from the library, but able to download free booksIt's good for basic e-reader, listening to your own music, and for accessing whatever games, apps, etc. that will actually install/load.  I was finally able to run Pandora with a very strong internet connection and was finally able to install angry birds via getjar.I thought going with the 10 inch size would be the right choice, but now I wish I would have gone with the standard 7 inch as it seems that it would be easier to hold.Also, the usb port is read only- I could not figure out a way to transfer data to or from it.	
709	2	2	3	4	0	4	2	4	1	1	3	3	great for certain things. This is for the 10" coby. I got it to replace the functions of an e-ink kindle. I wanted to be able to read books, surf some simple web pages, maybe check my e-mail and calendar, play some simple games. I liked the idea of a bigger screen that I could see page-size pdf (and maybe a comic book) on. It turns out that this tablet is fine for those needs.It actually seems made pretty well. The touch screen seems to work well - by way of comparison, I've had a couple of older tablet pc's, and older windows ce pda's, my wife has an older resistive touch 7" android, I have an android phone. So on the one hand I've used a lot of touch screens, on the other, I can remember when you had to have a proprietary batter-powered stylus to use one. So to me, the touch screen seems pretty good, but I don't know how that will translate to others. It is a finger print magnet and picks up smudges like mad. It is perfectly adequate for e-book reading and playing simple android games.I am an average sized male and the size is fine for me for a big book reader. The trade off of the bigger screen is that you have a bigger device to hold. I can just "palm" it with one hand - it is 16 X 9 so it seems longer than it does wide. I don't think it is too large to be a comfortable reader.The wi-fi connected in a snap, couldn't be easier. One thing that is sort of annoying is that everytime I resume from a suspend I have to disconnect and reconnect the wi-fi for it to connect. I haven't figured a way around that yet, but I think it may be an ice cream sandwich "feature." It connects easily to our linux computers with the cable.I found that I was more bugged by the lack of google play marketplace than I thought I'd be. As best I can tell, everyone who has tried rooting the 10" has bricked it. So I didn't root it. You can get the apk for google play easy enough and side load it, but the device isn't on google's list of approved devices so the apk won't run and connect to the market. Because you can't root it, you can't edit the boot file to spoof it as a device on google's list. So unless you root it or google adds it you won't be connecting to google play.Which isn't really that big of a deal. It has a get jar market on it, but I had already put on amazon market before I bothered looking at it, and there's really not much use in it. The amazon market is easy enough for anyone to add - just point the web browser to amazon and follow the directions. Of all things, the only thing I wanted to put on it so far but wasn't able to yet is tux math for the kids - it is on google play but not amazon market and I can't find the apk on the web. It was easy enough to side load other apks. It runs the angry birds apps fine, and the cut the ropes, fruit ninjas, temple runs. I had a devil of a time getting where's my water/Perry to install. It just wouldn't install. I tried different versions and nothing, then one time I tried it for a lark and both just installed and now they play fine. I must have installed something with a needed library or something along the way. Who knows. I downloaded free solitaire and freecell from amazon and they work fine. That's enough games for me, so I haven't bothered putting any emulators on it, without hardware buttons I don't care to.It has both a regular size usb and a micro usb, which is nice because you can use something like a usb key board. The power plug is an additional little port. The batteries last longer than I thought they would - good enough for me to read and play some games. I put some videos on there just to see them and they worked fine. The kids watched some youtube on it and that was fine. I couldn't get netflix to install on it though.It has an micro sd card slot, that is important to me. The file structure is a little wonkey, but you'll find the sd card if you look around. After the first time it didn't really matter to me because it remembered the location in the history and I can just click the short cut there.It comes with a book reader built in. I side loaded an epub file and it seemed to present it just fine. I went ahead and put the cool reader app on it because I like the flexibility of that app. I used it to read A Dance with Dragons an it was a good book reading experience - I turned off the background and just use white text on black or yellow on blue. Honestly I didn't miss e-ink and I was a fan of it.It isn't an ipad and it isn't a tegra 3. It is $150 bucks. So if you want the ipad or a tegra 3 don't get this. If you have some basic android experience then this will seem familiar and easy, and if you want a basic tablet then this is a fine one. I got lucky here, it fits my needs very well - so if you are looking for something like that, book reader, web, simple games, with a bigger screen I'd recommend this to you.	
710	3	0	4	4	2	3	0	0	4	3	2	0	would not recommend. I would not recommend this tablet to a friend to say the least. For me it does what I needed it to do. Read e-books. I get advanced e-books from writers in exchange for reviews and I was in need of a tablet so I wouldn't be forced to sit on my hard (now 10 yr old) computer chair and read. It reads all media files pertaining to e-books and I'm happy with that, but when I first got it I made the mistake of trying to turn it on without charging it as I was spoiled by my Samsung Galaxy player that was fully charged out the box. Needless to say I got the white screen of warning, not death, but it wasn't a pleasant thing to see. Upon charging it, it worked fine.But now the downsides. The WiFi sucks. Plain and simple. I was sitting no less than a foot from my router and it refused to connect. I had to go into my router settings and rescan channels for it to work. And let me say it only works on wireless channel 11. Anything else and it refuses to pick up the connection. GetJar also sucks. No apps what-so-ever. Again I'm use to having Google Play at my finger tips and the Amazon shop app does not like this tablet. Yes it works, but it's slow and clunky feeling as it chugs along. The main reason I got this tablet was because it was larger and had android 4.0, so let me also state that flash does not work on this tablet as Adobe is no longer offering it for anything above 4.0. You can't side load it either. Yes it will install, but it won't work.Now lately the screen flickers half of the background image from left to right before it settles itself. Despite the wifi problem I've ways of by-passing that and the screen flickering recently I'm going to keep it as I don't have the time to stand in line at walmart and return it and then wait 3 days to see my money back in my account only to have to go hunting again. In the end it does what I need it to to. Read e-books.	
711	0	1	2	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	2	4	Meh. This item seems to work well, but I am unable to use a stylus with it and I often hit the wrong button. The buttons are too small for my fingers and my fingernails do not register just like the stylus. I am also missing actions when I use my e-mail account, not sure why.

713	0	4	3	0	2	4	1	4	2	4	2	3	so so...still discovering. It looks like a great table for the price, but I did not know that you can not use Google Play even is it is an android. I was very frustrated trying to set it up for my son and discovering that GetJar program for app that comes with it , it's not what I was looking for. It took me more than a few hours to realize that Google play wasn't going to work...finally I was able to instal Amazon App for android and that save my life!Now I am happier with it.Not parent control...Dislike.Not Google Play.....DislikeAmazon App ....YES, like it

719	0	3	1	3	2	1	4	4	2	4	0	0	Do Not Buy!!! I did some research on this tablet before I bought it. I was looking for something inexpensive but worked well. I just needed it for some light web surfing and to keep my 8 year old occupied when we go out. Its hard to download apps because it has GetJar which hardly has anything worth downloading.  You can download Amazon App Store and another app store but they kept force closing its extremely irritating.  I ended up returning it after 2 weeks and getting a Kindle Fire for roughly the same price which I love. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone for any reason.	
720	4	2	3	2	3	0	4	4	0	0	0	2	What junk! This was competitive in price with others but this just didn't deliver. It also came to me with an unlock problem. Goobye!

724	0	4	1	0	4	4	3	0	4	4	0	0	Never buy this product. I ordered this product for a Christmas gift for my elementary school aged daughter, thinking that it would be good enough for the games, videos and books she reads, and we could save a little bit of money.  After the initial hassle trying to get apps to work, it was ok (I followed the Q&A; on amazon to set up the app store). But after two weeks it stopped charging and it was a huge hassle trying to get anyone from the manufacturer to respond to my service request.  Now I am supposed to send it in to the manufacturer for repair or replacement, but I also have to include a money order for $15 to cover the return shipping.  Apparently they don't support their product enough to be able to cover the shipping costs for their customers - and no personal checks or credit cards are accepted for the return shipping payment.Incidentally, I also purchased the extended warranty, but they won't cover this because they say it is still covered under manufacturers warranty.  At this point, I just want my money back and to never look at this piece of junk again.Now that the prices for Kindle Fire have gone down, I just ordered one of those.  The cost difference is not that much anymore and I have had a great experience with my Kindle.It was definitely not worth the $50 price difference to order the COBY product.  It is unusable after less than one month.

I wanted a tablet that could meet the needs of my 12 year old son without having to spend close to a mortgage payment to get it. I had went through all the tablets on Amazon and other websites and this tablet had the best reviews.. Although it does not have Google play to download apps, The amazon Marketplace is spectacular, My son was so excited and has not put it down since he got it for Christmas. He is happy and that lets me know that I made the right choice for him..The pages load pretty quickly the apps are up to date and download with no problem and most of the popular ones are free. So I have no complaints at all .. He can listen to Pandora all day and the battery life does not die very quickly as I have seen in most reviews about the android tablet..	
726	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	2	3	Coby Kyros 10.1. For the price it's an Okay product. Upside - decent screen resolution, relatively easy system navigation and great for reading. Downside - disappointing the operating system does not allow access to Google market. Fix is download of apk file but a pain for a new product based on Android. Speaker sound quality okay but with ear buds no problem.

If you wish to keep your customers you should give them a rebate matching the lower price. This is wrong and you shouldn't treat customers this way. It's deceptive and shouldn't be allowed. It's only been 15 days since I bought it and I received it on the 25th. All you've done is make me think of going elsewhere to purchase any further tablets I may be in the market for.Coby Kyros 9.7-Inch Android 4.0 8 GB Internet Tablet 4:3 Capacitive Multi-Touchscreen with Built-In Camera, Black MID9740-8	
730	0	2	3	2	3	2	4	3	2	4	4	3	Very Pleased!! After reading all the reviews in late December, I was almost afraid to purchase this 8" coby tablet.Then I read further reviews that I can confirm what they had said , and yes there IS Adobe Flash installed when I received it, it is well made and designed, glass panel, HDMI output, computer to tablet cable included to move apps to the tablet or sd card and more.I paid $115 it is now $109. That is a steal!! This is a touchscreen 8" diag tablet that instantly connected to my wifi router, Had good apps installed on it and if you just google apps w/the .apk at end you will find many sites that carry the same apps as googleplay (which does not work if unrooted). So, many many aps out there. Total internet surfing. Great game playing.Yes the battery life is about 2 hours, but you can plug in and still use, plus it charges pretty quick.If this goes below $100 w free shipping I may get another as backup.Just do your homework and the solutions to most problems are there!Nice.Now, I hope I didn't jinx my tablet.I will update when trying out the 1080p video on my tv.Buy it, its inexpensive and works.  Dollar Tree sellls the stylus for , well, a buck.

I reset them and they started working again and now they have stick again about 10 times and one won't respond to touch.

733	4	0	0	2	0	4	4	4	2	0	1	0	A few good qualities but overall a disappointment. My wife is letting me order an Android tablet for my birthday so I was aiming for a $150 spending limit. I found this tablet and thought that it would be a nearly perfect fit. The specs looked good, a 10.1 inch display, I was won over. However when showing the link to my dad after I ordered it he pointed out the it does NOT have the Android Play Store on it. I thought no big deal. It's an Android tablet, how hard is it to get the play store downloaded? Biggest pain in the rear end ever... I picked up the package from the post office and gave up after a few hours. As far as I know there is no way to get the play store on there unless you root/jailbreak it; but even then the chances of it working are extremely slim. I tried out the GetJar store that comes with in instead of the PlayStore. WASTE OF TIME. They have the worst selection you could possibly find. Even a shoe store has a better selection of canned goods than GetJar has apps. My phone, which is outdated if not soon, can surf the internet faster than this tablet could. The only redeeming feature it had was the 10.1 inch screen. So unless your going to use it only for email/internet with little to no app downloading then dont bother. I had it for a few hours and then I put in right back in the box and shipped it away to get my money back.

Nor can i get any scanner apps to load like qr droid for selling on Amazon. And also when you shuut down the unit you have to uninstall the amazon app because it won,t work again ounce its, turn back on.Netflix works great and so does ebay and the amazon store app. but the pens that i bought as a package deal doesn,t  even when the setttings are set But  the keyboard case  works great however  when the google browser is opened its near inpossable to close the window because the X is near the top edge .This unit really gets me mad when you try to download apps you need and i was close to sending it back because of that but if i had  read the reviews i would not of bought this piece of s*** at all i'm really mad that i wasted 80 bucks period 1 unhappy customer unit (coby) its your choice  in what you buy Good day

They told me that I would have to send a $15 money order so the company could replace the device with a new tablet.I would never recommend this company to anyone.

Every day it loses my apps, ebooks, and has to be reset and sd card reloaded. I'm fed up with this brand! I FINALLY talked to someone at Amazon, and I'm now getting a refund, which in turn I'll use to buy another brand.

Unfortunately, the audio malfunctioned recently and we were told to contact Coby.  I've attempted to contact them for 3 MONTHS and got zero response, nothing, not even a "Coby received your email" auto response.  By far the worst customer service I have ever in my life dealt with.  On that alone I would suggest you avoid this company.

748	3	3	2	3	4	1	3	3	3	2	2	4	Probably one of the largest tablets for the money. Pros: Large screen, ok processor, large memory expansion capability, USB port, and pretty good quality material and screenCons: Somewhat laggy likely due to ice cream sandwich, the SD card expansion cannot be used to install programs (there are apps that supposedly allow you to do this but they have yet to work and yes I rooted the tablet successfully). The backlighting on the screen seams cheap since you can't see the picture at certain angles, the front facing camera is of poor quality and sucks if you dont' have bright lighting on you.

The tablet was still under warranty, so I contacted Coby and sent it back. Two months later, I still don't have my tablet and I can't get a reasonable answer as to when it will be fixed or replaced. I won't ever buy from Coby again.

752	0	0	2	0	3	3	4	0	0	4	1	0	Not Good at all!!! This tablet isn't any good, it restarts by itself, sometimes it just even shuts off by itself in the middle of of doing something. It runs pretty slow at times... all in all its not a good buy. I wouldn't recommend this tablet at all....

They work well however after 5 months one developed an issue with the power button that it simply would not push in anymore nor power up the unit. No exterior damage the switch just quit working. when trying to obtain warranty repairs you are directed to contact Coby USA via phone numbers listed on their website or email address for tech support and or customer support. None of the addresses or numbers (from the site) work as it appears the company has folded. No additional information or alternative method is offered too obtain warranty repairs.

761	3	4	4	4	0	1	3	0	1	3	0	0	Don't buy this. I bought this under my daughters account for my husband for Christmas. It only lasted 1 year. That's right 1 year. The screen will not come on. I got a new adapter, pushed the reset, & still nothing. I am not the only one with a tablet that will not come on. This is a defect. Has to be if a lot of others have this problem.	
762	2	4	4	1	2	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	So convenient. I had bought this product for someone else, but when I open it just to make sure it was working, I could not put it down, I just love the touch screen, the size, the view of the pictures after using the camera... I am now planing to get one for myself... I just love it...	
763	4	4	4	4	3	0	0	3	1	1	3	4	Good for the price. It's not the fastest or easiest to use but for $150.... it works.  I use it for one simply thing- emails when I'm on the road.  Do I browse, YES.  Do I facebook, YES. But it is a quick and easy way to respond to emails without my fingers cramping up on my smartphone.  Don't expect a Ipad for $150 and you will be fine.	
764	4	3	3	1	1	1	2	1	0	4	1	0	limited functionality. Purchased to use as internet browsed, ereader, and access to email. Have spent hours trying to connect & download books from library with no success. Browser very slow and locks up frequenty so downloaded Dolpin. Improved speed somewhat but still frequent wait messages.  Not fully certified with all Android apps. My first experience with Android wish I had stayed with Windows but glad I purchased inexpensive Tablet.	
765	4	4	1	3	0	3	2	0	2	4	1	0	crashes consistently. It freezes alot. Everytime I get on the web it crashes. Getjar doesn't want to work anymore. I can a)get games on unit and play just fine or b) delete everything so I can surf the web for 1 day without unit crashing and restarting while im doing something. Honestly its a piece, you definitely get what you pay for.	
766	0	4	4	4	0	3	4	3	4	4	0	0	Not Satisfied. I purchased this product after reading the mixed reviews.  Unfortunately I received a lemon.  Less than a month the tablet kept freezing and eventually did not turn on at all.  I do not recommend this product at all.  This was purchased to keep in touch with family members in Europe and thankfully I am able to return it.  I guess you really do get what you pay for!  The customer service never returned phone calls and the message line on the phone was always full.  They do respond to emails.  Amazon was quick into my service to return this item.  I am not impressed with this Visual Land product at all!
