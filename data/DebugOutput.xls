To put it simply: they have made me detest the very concept of tablets. I played with this tablet for 30 minutes and fell in love. It was the perfect Christmas gift for myself for all the hours I've been putting in but to my surprise, all those hours came to bite me in the arse. I get home one day and read news of preorders available. Product pages with active order options suddenly disappear from nearly every online retailer.Well not all. I found one after much scavenging of the internets and preordered a 32 GB model on the 26th of November, only to discover TODAY that the retailer's stock would not come in until January 8th.So thank you, Amazon, for lowering the expectation of shipment date and preventing any further orders when the supply did not meet the demand. Customers who expected a timely shipment of their units received $10 gift card codes and were given an adjusted shipment date while others who were of the first fortunate batch have already received their Primes. I know now to never second guess my natural tendency to want to order items from Amazon.But really, Amazon, 4 weeks? I know you can do better than THAT.

Asus has already announced another version of the Prime for Q2 and it has a redesigned shell to improve Wifi, GPS and Bluetooth !!!  With this being announced so early, before the original Prime has even been able to hit store shelves, its very obvious that Asus knew about the wireless issues of the Prime prior to releasing them. Rather than delay (remember rumored delays due to Wifi issues)and fix the issue they pushed the Primes out in time for good holiday sells, knowing it was flawed. All the time a new designed shell was already in the works and even possibly already in hand. Asus did add higher resolution screen on the new model but its likely this was to merit releasing it has a "different" Prime. Very poor move by Asus. I recommend not buying the Prime or the new version Prime.Below is a list of signficant flaws to consider when making your purchase decision. Please read the UPDATE sections below for more specific notes.1. Poor GPS caused by aluminum shell design2. Reduces Wifi range and performance (likely due to same shell as well)3. Drastically reduced Wifi performance when connected to and/or streaming to bluetooth device capable of music / video streams.UPDATE !!! So the issues keep coming. It is known now that there is an issue with using Bluetooh and Wifi at the same time. I have tested this myself and it seems to depend on exactly what the bluetooth is being used for. When used to stream music to a bluetooth headset or stereo, WiFi transfer rate is dramatically impacted.  I tested without bluetooth and was getting 13000 range kbps. With bluetooth streaming on the transfer dropped to 400 kbps and lower. This will be an issue for those that might like to stream music to their entertainment center while browsing on the Prime.UPDATE !!!! Asus has issued a statement concerning GPS issue. They have admitted it is due to the shell and will no longer list or market GPS as a feature. My review started off as 4 stars but to me this is a significant screw up and a sign of poor QC. Whats worse is that early rumors of delayed release due to Wifi issues shows that Asus knew of the problem then but decided Christmas sells were more important than delivering a product that worked the way it should. WiFi issues have also been confirmed and are due to the shell however the WiFi signal is still strong enough to work, but it could be and should be better.WiFi is also not optimal and with 3 units tested I found all three to have significantly shorter range than other devices like iPad 2, iPhone, laptop. Transfer speeds over Wifi are also slower. With all the devices running the same test and sitting the same distance from the router, the Prime came up with slower tranfers. As the distance from the wireless router was increased for each device, the transfer rates for the Prime suffered more than the other devices. So for example moving all devices to a bedroom 40 feet away with two walls between them and the wireless router, all the devices, except for the prime, showed the same level of transfer loss. The Prime on the other hand showed a greater loss.WATCH THIS VIDEO to see that the Prime does have WiFi performance issues.  [...]UPDATE !!!!  Well the rumored GPS issues were apparently real. So real in fact that Asus is no longer listing GPS as a feature of the Prime. Check the Asus site if you doubt. You might find it listed on other sites but that is only because ASUS does not have access to those sites to remove it.  This tells me that the GPS issue is more than likely due to a design flaw and since they are removing it from the list they will most certainly not continue trying to fix it,  because it probably cannot be fixed.  I had to take away a star for this reason.  Very shady tactic on part of Asus. Of course Zealots will brush this off as being an unimportant feature, even though they were sure to point it out as a great included feature that you must pay extra for on the iPad 2. I also forsee Asus adding it back to the specs but it will be for legal reasons only.I was lucky enough to get my hands on 3 of these, two of which were not even Pre Orders. One was a walk in to BB and the other online order from BB, which took only 3 days to process and ship to me. One was from Santa for my 11 year old daughter and the other two for me and my wife.I'm starting the Prime off with 5 stars and deducting or adding back as I go.- 2 Stars - Faulty GPS. Asus either did not test GPS or knew there was an issue and released it anyway. Either way is not good.Asus has removed GPS from the list of features on the Prime and admitted it is due to the shell.- 1/3 Star - BackLight Bleeding on all three.When held in landscape mode the location of the light bleed is on the right side just below the corner. The bleed is not subtle either. On two of the units there are two distinct sections next to eachother. On the third unit its one less distinct area. Being in the same location I am wondering if its a quality control or design issue. It does not stand out under normal use unless that area is dark and has no graphics to cover it. It will stand out during movies when that section is dark.- 1/3 Star - Case / Glass separation on all three.The next thing noticed on all three is a cracking sound when holding along the left side in landscape mode near the volume rocker. If you press there you can see the glass move in as you press.  I think this is a design issue and maybe has something to do with the volume rocker. When viewed from the side (thin view), you can see the glass sticks up slightly higher there. Its as if the glass was suppose to be snapped in but it did not hold.- 1/3 Star - Crashes and Interface issues.I should not really deduct for the OS Interface since its probably not the fault of the device but since it is a part of the device I will. We have experienced crashes although not in excess. Its usually on the browser. I also find that sometimes tapping an icon is not responsive and you must tap several times. Its as if the touch screen stops sensing. This was noticed on the Xoom and the Fire as well so I would say its an OS issue.+ 1 Star - Is for the performance and overall experience with the device. This thing is fast and that is using it in the mid performance setting.Boot Time -  YIKES !!  1 minute boot time ! I will not deduct from this because we generally will let it sleep and not power off until night time.Sound - The speaker seems sufficient to me. I would not have a problem using it for watching a movie or gaming as long as there were not others around that might be annoyed.Screen - The screen looks amazing. Viewing angles seems to be very good. For example sitting at the end of couch with the Prime facing me directly, my daughter and wife sitting to my left could view without having to lean back and over towards me.Quality - In my opinion could have been better, specifically the backlight bleed and cracking along edge that I already pointed out. If those were not present I would not have anything negative to say about the quality of the prime.Is this an iPad2 killer ? I do not think so. If you hate Apple then of course you will think it is. Heck the Apple haters thought the Xoom was the iPad 2 killer. I'm not a hater or zealot of either side. Fact is Apple has really polished their OS. I think once the Android OS gets polished and tweaked a bit that I would definitely put the Prime on top. Maybe the next update in January 2012 ?  If the update is focused on improvements to the current OS and not just a bunch of new features that will open up new problems then I think it will be very promising. I have my fingers crossed.<<<UPDATE>>>  I exchanged one our Primes, which had the worst backlight bleed, at our local BB. The replacement was much better. The cracking / moving glass near volume rocker is not there. Bleed is so minor that I would call it no bleed at all; however the minor bleed I can see is in the same exact spot as the others. I also researched some and found a review that mentioned the bleed and it was in the same location as well.I have been reading complaints for WiFi and GPS issues. I have no way to test the wifi speed but must admit that I see constant fluctuation of signal strenght on the Prime. Apparently the GPS issue is signal strength related. What I have read is that it is strong enough to lock on and give your location but not strong enough to maintain a lock if mobile, for example if you were trying to use it for navigation from point A to B.	
2	4	4	4	4	2	1	0	1	4	0	2	4	Updated...  Just OK. I purchased from Best Buy over a year ago (updated 4.2.13).  It was the hot tablet on the market at that time.  I liked it just fine for a few months.  It was a bit buggy and had a few issues, but overall I was satisfied.  I won a iPad 3 in a drawing a few months later.  At first, my thoughts were to give the iPad to my wife and use my Asus tablet.  I decided to keep the iPad and do a side by side comparison.  It didn't take me long to discover why the iPad was so popular.  When compared to my Transformer android tablet, there really was no comparison.  With this said, I gave my Transformer to my boss, kept the iPad (which I love), bought my wife a iPad Mini for Christmas, and just got an iPhone 5.  You get the idea???  The iPad 3 convinced me that Apple's products were greatly superior.	
3	0	1	4	1	0	4	4	4	2	1	1	2	Very disappointed. I was very excited to pick get one of these. However I ended up returning it. When I first powered it on I noticed some light bleeding on the screen\, which is annoying considering how I kept hearing how good the screen is. Then I compared it to my wife's ipad, and there was a huge difference. The "white" on the transformer screen wasn't really white, it was yellow. Again another annoyance on what I thought was a strength.The screen issues were annoying, but not that big of a deal, what is a big deal is that the WIFI seems to be crippled. Poor  wifi signals, and poor connection speeds led me to return it. I ended up add another wifi router hoping that it would improve the connection speeds, it did not. It would be a great product, expect that, you know, wifi is terrible, web browsing is terrible, any type of connections is slow..	
4	0	1	3	4	3	4	2	4	4	1	0	0	Shiny is about it. I never write reviews since there are more than enough people who are happy to post their opinion about an item.  I'm writing this one since this is by far the biggest technology disappointment I've ever had, and I want people to avoid making the mistake I made by going for a brand new shiny unproven product that has been hyped up so much that it had me drooling over it for months.  If you purchased a Prime and got one of the good ones, or if this is your first tablet and you think it meets your expectations.... great... good for you... enjoy your tablet.  I, on the other hand, got one of the many devices plagued by numerous defects.  After researching tablets for over a month, I purchased an Asus Transformer TF101 for my father.  When I configured and set it up, I was highly impressed and I believe it to be one of the best tablets out there for the money.  This made me drool over the prospect of getting a TF Prime for myself.  With all the glowing reviews from the geek sites, I figured why not treat myself and get the best out there.  I placed my order in mid December knowing that I wouldn't receive it for about a month.  After Google's Ice Cream Sandwhich OS was released for the Prime, I got more excited and started reading all the reviews about how it was functioning for users who already upgraded.  That's when I came upon numerous reviews complaining about poor GPS, WiFi connectivity, and ICS causing issues.  I hoped that this would not be the case for me.  After all, my new TF Prime had not been stocked yet, and Asus would have already started addressing the issues and have a solution in place by the time mine stocked/shipped.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  Upon, receiving my TF Prime, I was indeed impressed by the stunning look, feel, weight, and screen.  I charged it up, and downloaded ICS update.  No sooner than the tablet downloaded ICS did it start to freeze, reboot every time I tried to open a standard app like the camera, 1 inch horizontal black lines plagued the screen, slow internet for the 20 seconds I was able to browse the web before it rebooted, and it litterally was unusable.  I am a technology guy so I know it wasn't a user error of interrupting the upgrade to ICS while it was loading or doing something like rooting it before upgrading... or any of the other basic mistakes most people make when they complain about their devices not working properly out of the box.  When I called Asus to troubleshoot, yes - they were nice, but NO they could not recommend any fixes for me but to do a factory reset of the item... which I had already tried 3 times and which made the issues worse.  They told me that I could send it (out of pocket of course) to the Asus repair facility, and it would be 'fixed' but not replaced with a brand new one unless it was truly in a state in which it could not be repaired... so great... best case scenario is that it is completely defective (hardware) or else I just paid full price for a refurbished model... in addition to the fix of replacing the back with the TF700 plastic back to 'improve on' the GPS and WiFi issues... they said they only had grey backs and not the Champagne... so again, great.  It's like bying a red Ferrari and finding out the carbon fiber hood makes the thing slow and clunky, then having them tell you they can replace it with a new plastic Orange hood that doesn't even match the original color.  Anyhow, I've returned my Prime to Amazon for a full refund... and now I see that they've jacked up the price on these by $115????  What a gip... and to find out that Asus is now launching the TF700 series near the end of Q2 with the only real enhancement being the front facing camera going form a 1.2 to 2.0 Mega Pixel and the upgraded screen resolution which is nice, but on a 10 inch. tablet is a bit much and a huge battery drain for an extra $100 that they will be charging for the 16GB model.  I might hold out for the TF700 which I'd recommend anyone cosidering a Prime, but then again for that price, I might just buy an original Transformer TF101 series, and get a docking station all for $350 less.  Asus dropped the ball on this one... and being in Software/Hardware Quality assurance business myself... I can tell you this whole launch reeks of Asus going on a complete money grab with a FUBAR release schedule, numerous missed deadlines, rushed manufacturing process to get these out to meet the demand caused by the buzz, ZERO QA on the machines being pushed out, and then realizing they've failed massively and as a result rushing to launch the TF700 in hopes people will forget what a huge bust the TF Prime was.  If I'm and Apple marketing person, I'm using Asus as prime example on why customers should by an iPad 3 and not believe the hype that other tablets are catching up to them.... and that is hard for me to say being that I'm not a fan of Apple products.  I know even the best company occasionally has a few an occasional issue with one of their products, but I've read so many reviews and similar cases in the transformer/Asus forums that I know this isn't one of those isolated cases.  Again, save your money... go with an original TF101 with docking station for $450 or wait for the TF700 - 16GB for $600... or if you must have a tablet now look at the Samsung Galaxy or something along these lines...	
5	0	0	1	1	3	4	4	2	1	3	4	4	I really want to give this 4.5 stars. I really want to give this 4.5 stars12pm today 1/20/2012.  I was super excited but honestly really nervous from all the hate this tablet has been getting on xda.  Regardless i decided to take a risk and get this, since I had been eyeing the original transformer since its launch last year.Pros:1) Form factor: This thing is SEXY, and I wanted the champagne but I have no complaints baout the gray.  It is light and thin but very comfortable to hold and very solid feeling.2) Display: Man this thing has a great, vibrant bright display. my unit had really minor light bleed, barely noticeable and only in the boot screen.3) Performance/Graphics.  Comes preloaded with Glowball and Riptide GP demo, I definately showed it off to my partner who was very impressed. I played around with Android 3.2.1 for 2 hours just so I could experience the difference bewteen ICS and HC. Then I upgraded to ICS...wow this thing got smooth, it was already mostly smooth before but the browser was a night and day difference and the keyboard with swype is nice.Cons:Only have one right now and its Asus'big problem with the TFP..Wi-fi and GPS.  I don't care about the GPS but I was really sad to see that my unit didn't even find a satelite let alone lock onto one and Wi-fi was on... :(.  I could live with that really, even though it is advertised on the box (deducted 1/2 star)What really ruined my day was when I went downstairs with my TFP. I was super happy with it when I was laying on my bed upstairs which is maybe 8ft from the router. As soon as I went into my dining room and walked into my kitchen (20ft from router), the signalwentfrom 4/4 bars to 2/4.  I HAVE A BRAND NEW ROUTER that is top of the line...the good news is that when I went to the basement (30ft) it stayed at 2/4 bars.  I could still stream HQ videos at this signal strength but my iPhone and my partner's Atrix both register full wi-fi signals. (-1/2 star)At this point my enthusiasm is more tamed, I am already loving this device but the Wi-fi may be a dealbreaker.  Perhaps I have a defective unit...regardless I plan on taking this to my university and testing how well it mages the wifi there and will go around town to various starbucks to test too.  If it turns out to manage well I plan on keeping this device and upgrading to the TF700T in 6 mos, if not I will RMA/exchange and try one more before I give up and try a different device.  the problem is there really is no device on par with this on specs as of now... Asus really has something hereUPDATE 1/21: I ended up downloading the speedtest.net app on my TFP , my iPhone 4,  my laptop and my friend`s Atrix. My TFP outperformed my iPhone and Atrix at all three locations in the house sometimes by a lot...it was comparable to my laptop, but a little worse.  This morning I tried the test from the first comment below and got similar results, even in the basement at its farthest from the router the signal showed as excellent. I will test this out at my university and other places and if this stays consistent i willdefinitely keep this so far I am happy!Oh and GPS randomly started to work as well... still not too good but it catches 6 to 8 satellites and looks on 5 to 6with WiFi on,i found when WiFi is off i get the same amount in sight but it doesn't luck on it locked onto 4 satellites twice but only for a few seconds.In response to the second comment I find my TFP to be really fast and smooth like my iphone 4 but I have noticed a glitch once and in certain apps it gets laggy....overall im happy with it since I am not the biggest fan of Apples tactics eitherUPDATE 2:The Asus Mycloud app is amazing i can access my laptop remotely while on my tab which means access to all my files and to Microsoft Word! It also works very smooth without any hiccups. Also the webstorage app is cool i out music on it and can access it on my pad...this thing keeps getting better.UPDATE: Just got my keyboard dock today and I love my Prime it is perfect besides the GPS which functions but barely..I LOVE the keyboard dock :) I've tested WiFi ins several areas and it works perfectly :)	
6	1	0	4	3	4	0	1	0	2	0	4	4	Best tablet I have seen. After several weeks watching, pre-ordering, cancelling, and so on. Worried about wifi issue, I finally decided to buy this tablet with my fingers crossed. Was the best Idid!!!.  This device is perfect. It seems the ones new don't have wifi issues. Buy it! You won't  regret!!lt is much better than any tablet in the market by far!!!	
7	0	0	4	1	4	4	2	1	4	2	3	4	I don't ususally review products. I've had prime (tabby) for about 30 days.  In that time I can say I've gotten lots of compliments on a great screen, and build design, several people went to buy one after seeing mine.  The Tegra 3 is a beast, this is the first tablet that's closer to a computer and less like a phone in part due to the power provided by the Tegra 3.  Now its up to software designers to release "real" software, like dreamweaver and all of the creative suite.  I love typing on this thing, landscape is great for two hands, portrait allows you to type with two thumbs.  The viewing angles are excellent and important as part of the reason for such a tablet is for sales.  The micro hdmi out port provides a useful setup for meetings.The wifi is as good as any other device I own and significantly better than the droid x.  I believe the diversity antennas do a good job.  However the GPS on my unit is completely useless even in wide open outdoor areas. I have set up my phone to tether GPS data to the tabby although I don't utilize it often (ever) for navigation.  UPDATE: ASUS to provide free GPS dongles to all, and improved RF after the C3 models.ICS on this sandwich is awesome, very stable.  Able to multitask seamlessly.  The browser still needs work - I think a high performance mode would be useful. I toggle plugins on demand and tabby does a great job.  The resolution seems more than adequate for me although if a tf201- tf700 upgrade path was made available I might consider it.  ICS kills ad-hoc networking beware.  Tethered with an LTE device this thing flies.The construction is slvete, connections will leave some exposure and I often baby the device by not using it while charging.  BTW the batteries are excellent.  I will say that there is a slight click if I press down on several areas of the screen and/or back.  Nothing to make me send it back, but something I will look out for.  I got the dock some time later.  Didn't think I'd use it, but I was wrong.  It turns this thing into a highend ultrabook.I have to say I'm surprised how much I enjoy and use tabby.  I am a little disappointed with how much personal information google tries to digest.  Really google you need to know all my applications even the ones I installed on my own?  Really, Google I can't delete or reset that information.  Really google I can't stop using Google Play because half of my apps are authenticated through it, but I'm getting really close to deleting my account-- I'm not sure that will stop google from compiling data on you though, just in different ways.	
8	1	3	0	0	3	4	1	1	4	0	4	4	Slick Tablet. Jaw dropping performance, decent battery life (absolutely unmatched if using the dock), removable storage, HDMI out, ICS, and one of the best tablet screens around. Went to this from a TF101 (another great tablet) and it was a solid upgrade. It cannot be overstated just how much ICS improves upon prior Android versions. It's like the difference between Windows 95 and Windows 7, so if you've tried Android in the past and found it lacking in polish it's time for another look. This thing is Sexy with a capital S. Don't be a sheep, try this baby out and you will never look back.Note:I haven't had any GPS issues, though many have reported problems. Asus has said they are working to correct the issue, and I would take their word for it given my experience with their other products (laptops, desktop and server motherboards, etc). That said, if GPS is critical to your selection in a tablet I would probably look elsewhere, as I don't expect the TF201 will ever be perfect in this regard. More Tegra 3 tablets will be available soon, or you could borrow your grandparent's iPad.	
9	4	0	1	3	4	2	1	4	4	4	4	4	Works great!! I may not be a power user, but I received my TF201 Transformer Prime 3 days ago and I absolutely love it!  Before I ordered my Prime i read just about every review, while there were plenty on both sides the reviews along with my own independent research made me a believer over iPad and i am glad I did and am confident I made the right choice.Don't let the negative reviews sway you, but do your research and get the tablet that's the best fit for you.  If your a Windows, Apple, Droid user learning a new Operating System might prove difficult.  I am a traditional Windows user, but the leap to Droid wasn't that big of a leap at all.I am preparing this review on my tablet.I have also read many reviews saying there aren't many Apps for this tablet, from what i have found, there are thousands.In closing I like the new ICS operating system and like the tablet overall.	
10	0	0	3	4	4	2	0	2	1	0	1	4	2nd Prime wifi was no better than 1st. I actually loved everything about both of my 32 GB primes but in my house the wifi did not work on all floors and did not work at all outside. I have other devices that worked fine. I had to add a second AP router on the main floor to get consitent service. GPS is non existent but you will find very few reviewers who have working GPS and most will say it does not matter. Firmware updates worked fine for me but again differing results for different users. You have to be a member of at least one forum to get good information and keep up on the latest information and issues. If you love gadgets and you don't mind reviewing issues and finding solutions then this is a great product. If you need rock solid wifi similar to your other wifi devices you will have to hope you get better units than I received. My second one was returned via RMA yesterday. Also note Asus customer support is varied for this product because of all the issues that have surfaced. With each new firmware release some users are having issues and the next release is usually related to that instead of something for everyone. ICS is really pretty good and don't let anyone tell you there are not apps for Android, I had no issues finding free apps for what I needed. I had high hopes that things would be better 2 months after the initial release but alas for me that was not the case. I will not purchase another Asus tablet.	
11	4	4	3	4	0	3	3	2	0	4	4	4	Perfect! I have not had any of the issues that some people have had. WIFI is great throughout my house. No problems with rebooting or freezing. However, I haven't checked the GPS. I didn't buy it for that.I worried about ordering the tablet based on the negative reviews. But because of the quantity of positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. I am glad that I did.Also, Amazon gave me an expected delivery date of around March 15, but it was delivered two days ago. Good job Amazon!	
12	1	4	4	4	0	3	1	1	2	0	4	4	That transformer is really PRIME. The devise is very comfortable and handy to use. Has a very fast-working CPU and really good graphic capabilities. Plus a very easy to use comfortable virtual keyboard. Touch screen is exceptional. Very good buy.	
13	4	4	4	0	0	1	0	4	4	2	4	4	Fantastic. I absolutely love my Asus Transformer Prime.  I initially went to purchase an ebook but when I saw the Prime, there was no decision.  I also purchased the keypad to which it docks.  A great tool that I take everywhere and use everyday.Frank	
14	4	4	0	4	4	4	1	0	4	3	4	4	Fabulous purchase.. I love my TF201 Transformer Prime.  Amazon delivered quickly and I could not ask for a better product.  In fact, I was so impressed I purchased the docking station last weekend and it arrived last night.  It is currently attached and charging so I have not yet had the opportunity of using it.	
15	4	4	4	2	0	2	4	4	3	4	3	4	Tablet review. I waited for the new Ipad 3 to come out and when it did not have anything new I decided to purchase a product that would do what I wanted.  This tablet is well built and meets my needs.  I needed some when I travel to play games watch movies an listen to music as well as do email and internet.  This tablet does all of that with no problems.  It has a great run time wonderful screen and camera to boot.  It flickers sometimes so wonder if something is not quite right but it has never had a problem other than that.  My only real complaint is more of my knowledge that I have more learning curve of operating and backing it up than I thought I would but I am sure I will overcome that.  It appears to work better with windows 7 than the machine I want to use that is windows XP.  Over all I can highly recommend this tablet.	
16	2	0	1	4	4	1	4	2	4	4	4	4	Prime > Ipad. I purchased this is a no-nonsense alternative to the Ipad.  Anyone who has an android phone will feel right at home with the simple/easy interface.  A productivity suite is included with the prime, and the inclusion of a dock essentially transforms it into a slim/light netbook.  MP4 videos play nicely on the high-res screen, and the performance couldn't be better (even on games like GTA III, 10th anniversary edition).  There are a few more apps for Ipads, but the Prime is poised to topple the king of tablets.	
17	4	0	4	4	4	2	1	1	0	4	4	4	Tried 2 tablets before buying this one. So, the last person on planet earth that thought he would ever have a need or desire for a tablet was me. I work 10 hours on a computer day in and day out (IT manager) and I work another two hours at night on my Dell XPS system post-processing photography and HD video (hobby and side business)My wife purchased the Motorola Xoom, loaded with ICS 4.0. I was pleasantly surprised with the performance and how far along the Adroid OS had come along! Then my son bought a new iPad2, which is nice as well (Can't tell that the resolution is higher unless you zoom waaaaaay in on the text) but I'm not an apple guy (Don't drink the Kool aid!) and it was apparent to me that there was equal competition out there in Tablet land.After researching for 6 weeks (Using hands-on demos, Tabletnation.net, and CNET.com for references) I pulled the trigger on the ASUS Transformer Prime.I bought the keyboard accessory as well.After 8 weeks of purchase, my Dell XPS 8100 gathers dust (except for post-processing video) and I am thoroughly happy with this tablet. I use it for travel, at work (accessing my cell phone provider data plan on my Android phone, WITHOUT rooting the phone nor the need for a 2nd data plan, thank you) and it is very nice to have just the tablet in bed at night to read. I cannot express my happiness and pleasant experience thus for using this ASUS Transformer Prime tablet.	
18	0	4	0	3	1	4	4	2	4	4	1	4	Not much of an improvement over the tf101. I sold my tf101 and bought the prime and from what I had read it was suppose to be quite a bit snappier and have other marked advantages.So far the other thing I notice that it does that my old one didn't is get very hot. This thing puts out a lot of heat, almost to the pointwhere you can't have it resting on your lap. It will be great for the winter.I actually notice this tablet locking up and stalling more often than my last one. It truly seems to be less powerful, which I know can't bethe case, but real world experience for me is showing it to be true. When playing back video it is just as jarring as the previous model. Thereisn't a single point when using this tablet that I would call it "smooth". It really does nothing "smooth".Also note, if you're expecting a mini-hdmi port, it doesn't have one. It's a micro, so those cables you have are now obsolete.I should have went ahead and kept the old one as it actually seemed like a better tablet.EDIT: Found out some more! The WIFI and GPS signal on this this is horrible! The older model gets a much better WIFI signal, and this thing can't get a GPS signal at all!Battery life is suppose to be over 10 hours?!?! It's 2.5 hours using it lightly before it's dead!! This is not an exaggeration!  This tablet is a mess!Very disappointed.	
19	4	4	2	4	4	0	3	0	1	4	4	4	EXCELLENT. It combines the best of 2 worlds: Fun and Productivity. Even though it is a little bit slower than iPad, I find it absolutely useful at work... and excellent for just playing with it	
20	4	4	0	1	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	Love IT!!!! Purchased 6 of the Asus TF201 tablet to be used at work, a month later we purchased 6 iPad2 to be used at work. The Asus ran circles around the iPad2. Easier to setup,use, and manage than the iPad2. I used to take my laptop with me when I traveled, now I leave the laptop in my office and take the tablet instead. I'm the IT Director where I work, and I'm now looking at ways to make it interact/cross platform to the network. I see this replacing my workstation down the road. I recommend it to everyone who asks me what tablet I think is best.	
21	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	2	4	4	Simply Awesome. Okay. Yeah, it can replace your laptop. Yep battery life is great. Yep, keyboard is great. Blah blah.. ..here is why I love mine.I left it on my car and drove off .  If fell off my car, then was driven over and minus scratches it works flawlessly.  Hell, it didn't even need a reboot after being driven over.Well built, thank you Asus.	
22	4	0	1	4	0	1	4	4	3	2	0	0	Don't buy this tablet. I bought the ASUS Prime tablet about nine months ago and it has been nothing but a disappointment.  First the only good thing I have to say about it.  I also bought the attachable keyboard which works well and really extends the battery life of the unit.Now the problems.  First the GPS flat out doesn't work, it won't pick up a GPS signal even outside in the yard.  Asus supplied for a time (expired August 2012) an external GPS antenna, but you can't use the keyboard with the antenna.  Secondly the wifi receiver only picks up the strongest of signals.  I had to add an access point in my family room just for the Asus to be able to work.  I sat in the Fort Lauderdale airport the other day while traveling and the unit would keep dropping the free wifi signal despite that fact that my smartphone showed excellent signal strength.  The onboard audio is so weak that even with noise cancelling earphones you can't hear movies or videos played through the unit in any place with a little noise like an airport or moving car.Finally the last straw was Asus support.  If you're outside the 90 day free technical support period, they won't honor the warranty (even though the warranty is supposed to be a one year warranty).  They want you to pay $166 for a service contract so they can determine over the phone whether the problem is a "software" (not covered under warranty) or a "hardware" problem before they will agree to even look at your unit.  I plan on selling my unit on ebay and buying something else.	
23	0	3	0	4	0	4	4	4	4	1	0	0	Super poor customer support. I don't even know where you start, I guess with the pros.Pro: It performs very well when running apps.Cons: NO GPS lock.- DO NOT USE THE ASUS UNLOCK TOOL. Using it will void both your software AND hardware warranty, you know, because the GPS works soooooo well before you use the unlock tool.- You can get a free GPS dongle. Which adds a huge bulge to your otherwise slick tablet. Again, you must register your tablet before a certain date to get the dongle for free, and you MUST NOT have used the ASUS unlock tool.- The one I bought had the screen coming unglued on one side. Now, my particular seller was amazing and took the tablet back due to the manufacturer defect, but I won't be buying this model of tablet ever...or anything else from ASUS...ever.	
24	4	4	0	1	0	0	1	4	4	4	4	4	ASUS Transformer Prime. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a tablet with lots of memory.  I got high rating from consumer reports.	
25	4	2	4	0	4	1	4	3	4	2	1	3	Should perform far better for the price. I've had the Asus Transformer Prime for approximately two years now, and I am a little disappointed.  The touch screen keyboard is slow to react.  Web pages are slow to load.  The browser crashes often. When you tap a field to enter text, it takes a long time for the keyboard to appear at the bottom of the screen.  Basically, it takes forever to do ANYTHING other than check email or facebook.  I fine myself reverting back to the desktop if I need to do any web browsing.  My wife has and ipad, and that thing flies!  Super reactive keyboard, videos load very quickly and the browser never crashes.  The Transformer Prime and Ipad are about the same price sooooo.... go with the ipad.

Would recommend this to anyone wanting a powerful 10.1 tablet.

29	0	1	0	4	4	0	3	2	4	4	3	2	significant design issues. GPS very poor, WiFi poor but workeable, all due to very poor rear cover design and pre sales testing not to mention magazine reviews which did not indicate these issues until very late in the product life. My rear camera stopped working after 24 months seems like a dry joint on the board as pressing the rear cover can fix it. I have a TF701T now and all these issues have been resolved. When the camera went I decided to get a new tablet and I was happy with my TF201T even given the issues, so went for an Asus again rather than a Samsung Note 10.1. The dock with the 701T has issues and as a result when I replace it  I'm probably leaning towards a Samsung in the future UNLESS Asus replace the Dock (highly unlikely). My review has 4 stars but to be honest it's  3.5 stars given the issues stated above but strangely I liked my tablet.	
30	2	1	4	4	3	1	4	0	0	1	4	4	quick once we figured out why I got sent a used one an paid for a new one. The second one they sent was new in the box. I love my transformer. I also ordered a keyboard and I love how most aps are free unlike the ipad.	
31	0	4	0	0	1	4	4	4	2	1	3	3	Fast, sleek, two flaws. The ASUS Transformer Prime is a great tablet. It's super fast and very easy to use. The construction of the tablet is top-notch. It's a nice weight and the screen is incredibly clear.Now for the two flaws... The plug port is on the bottom (the opposite side of the camera). That means if you use a case/cover like the rooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle, you can't charge the tablet while using the case stand. The tablet has to be laying flat instead of angled while charging. Moving the charge port to one of the short sides (from the long side) would fix this issue.The second flaw is the cable. Mine completely came apart at the USB end where it plugs into the wall charger. I had to use black electrical tape to hold it together, and now the tablet doesn't indicate it's charging when plugged in. Luckily, it does still charge, but the cable isn't communicating that to the tablet. Based on other reviews, this seems to be a common problem.Overall, I'd recommend this tablet and it would get 5 stars by moving the charger port and constructing a better cable.	
32	2	4	4	4	4	3	0	0	1	4	4	4	Wow! I already knew this tablet would be good with the NVIDIA TEGRA 3 processor and the SEXY SLEEK DESIGN.  After using the tablet for a while, I am also extremely impressed with the SUPER IPS+ display and the great built in sound.  All of my friends with ipads are jealous and keep asking to use it.  Considering it is the best tablet on the market, it is a steal at the current price.	
33	0	4	4	3	1	4	0	4	0	4	0	1	ASUS ALREADY HAD IMPROVED SHELL DESIGN BEFORE RELEASING PRIME. This first paragraph is all you need to read. Everything else was prior to latest news. Asus has already announced another version of the Prime for Q2 and it has a redesigned shell to improve Wifi, GPS and Bluetooth !!!  With this being announced so early, before the original Prime has even been able to hit store shelves, its very obvious that Asus knew about the wireless issues of the Prime prior to releasing them. Rather than delay (remember rumored delays due to Wifi issues)and fix the issue they pushed the Primes out in time for good holiday sells, knowing it was flawed. All the time a new designed shell was already in the works and even possibly already in hand. Asus did add higher resolution screen on the new model but its likely this was to merit releasing it has a "different" Prime. Very poor move by Asus. I recommend not buying the Prime or the new version Prime.Below is a list of signficant flaws to consider when making your purchase decision. Please read the UPDATE sections below for more specific notes.1. Poor GPS caused by aluminum shell design2. Reduces Wifi range and performance (likely due to same shell as well)3. Drastically reduced Wifi performance when connected to and/or streaming to bluetooth device capable of music / video streams.UPDATE !!! So the issues keep coming. It is known now that there is an issue with using Bluetooh and Wifi at the same time. I have tested this myself and it seems to depend on exactly what the bluetooth is being used for. When used to stream music to a bluetooth headset or stereo, WiFi transfer rate is dramatically impacted.  I tested without bluetooth and was getting 13000 range kbps. With bluetooth streaming on the transfer dropped to 400 kbps and lower. This will be an issue for those that might like to stream music to their entertainment center while browsing on the Prime.UPDATE !!!! Asus has issued a statement concerning GPS issue. They have admitted it is due to the shell and will no longer list or market GPS as a feature. My review started off as 4 stars but to me this is a significant screw up and a sign of poor QC. Whats worse is that early rumors of delayed release due to Wifi issues shows that Asus knew of the problem then but decided Christmas sells were more important than delivering a product that worked the way it should. WiFi issues have also been confirmed and are due to the shell however the WiFi signal is still strong enough to work, but it could be and should be better.WiFi is also not optimal and with 3 units tested I found all three to have significantly shorter range than other devices like iPad 2, iPhone, laptop. Transfer speeds over Wifi are also slower. With all the devices running the same test and sitting the same distance from the router, the Prime came up with slower tranfers. As the distance from the wireless router was increased for each device, the transfer rates for the Prime suffered more than the other devices. So for example moving all devices to a bedroom 40 feet away with two walls between them and the wireless router, all the devices, except for the prime, showed the same level of transfer loss. The Prime on the other hand showed a greater loss.WATCH THIS VIDEO to see that the Prime does have WiFi performance issues.  [...]UPDATE !!!!  Well the rumored GPS issues were apparently real. So real in fact that Asus is no longer listing GPS as a feature of the Prime. Check the Asus site if you doubt. You might find it listed on other sites but that is only because ASUS does not have access to those sites to remove it.  This tells me that the GPS issue is more than likely due to a design flaw and since they are removing it from the list they will most certainly not continue trying to fix it,  because it probably cannot be fixed.  I had to take away a star for this reason.  Very shady tactic on part of Asus. Of course Zealots will brush this off as being an unimportant feature, even though they were sure to point it out as a great included feature that you must pay extra for on the iPad 2. I also forsee Asus adding it back to the specs but it will be for legal reasons only.I was lucky enough to get my hands on 3 of these, two of which were not even Pre Orders. One was a walk in to BB and the other online order from BB, which took only 3 days to process and ship to me. One was from Santa for my 11 year old daughter and the other two for me and my wife.I'm starting the Prime off with 5 stars and deducting or adding back as I go.- 2 Stars - Faulty GPS. Asus either did not test GPS or knew there was an issue and released it anyway. Either way is not good.Asus has removed GPS from the list of features on the Prime and admitted it is due to the shell.- 1/3 Star - BackLight Bleeding on all three.When held in landscape mode the location of the light bleed is on the right side just below the corner. The bleed is not subtle either. On two of the units there are two distinct sections next to eachother. On the third unit its one less distinct area. Being in the same location I am wondering if its a quality control or design issue. It does not stand out under normal use unless that area is dark and has no graphics to cover it. It will stand out during movies when that section is dark.- 1/3 Star - Case / Glass separation on all three.The next thing noticed on all three is a cracking sound when holding along the left side in landscape mode near the volume rocker. If you press there you can see the glass move in as you press.  I think this is a design issue and maybe has something to do with the volume rocker. When viewed from the side (thin view), you can see the glass sticks up slightly higher there. Its as if the glass was suppose to be snapped in but it did not hold.- 1/3 Star - Crashes and Interface issues.I should not really deduct for the OS Interface since its probably not the fault of the device but since it is a part of the device I will. We have experienced crashes although not in excess. Its usually on the browser. I also find that sometimes tapping an icon is not responsive and you must tap several times. Its as if the touch screen stops sensing. This was noticed on the Xoom and the Fire as well so I would say its an OS issue.+ 1 Star - Is for the performance and overall experience with the device. This thing is fast and that is using it in the mid performance setting.Boot Time -  YIKES !!  1 minute boot time ! I will not deduct from this because we generally will let it sleep and not power off until night time.Sound - The speaker seems sufficient to me. I would not have a problem using it for watching a movie or gaming as long as there were not others around that might be annoyed.Screen - The screen looks amazing. Viewing angles seems to be very good. For example sitting at the end of couch with the Prime facing me directly, my daughter and wife sitting to my left could view without having to lean back and over towards me.Quality - In my opinion could have been better, specifically the backlight bleed and cracking along edge that I already pointed out. If those were not present I would not have anything negative to say about the quality of the prime.Is this an iPad2 killer ? I do not think so. If you hate Apple then of course you will think it is. Heck the Apple haters thought the Xoom was the iPad 2 killer. I'm not a hater or zealot of either side. Fact is Apple has really polished their OS. I think once the Android OS gets polished and tweaked a bit that I would definitely put the Prime on top. Maybe the next update in January 2012 ?  If the update is focused on improvements to the current OS and not just a bunch of new features that will open up new problems then I think it will be very promising. I have my fingers crossed.<<<UPDATE>>>  I exchanged one our Primes, which had the worst backlight bleed, at our local BB. The replacement was much better. The cracking / moving glass near volume rocker is not there. Bleed is so minor that I would call it no bleed at all; however the minor bleed I can see is in the same exact spot as the others. I also researched some and found a review that mentioned the bleed and it was in the same location as well.I have been reading complaints for WiFi and GPS issues. I have no way to test the wifi speed but must admit that I see constant fluctuation of signal strenght on the Prime. Apparently the GPS issue is signal strength related. What I have read is that it is strong enough to lock on and give your location but not strong enough to maintain a lock if mobile, for example if you were trying to use it for navigation from point A to B.	
34	0	0	3	0	0	4	1	4	0	4	4	4	Great Tablet for the price. This is what you expect for a $500 tablet.  Asus has truly listened to us and given us what we want.  Unlocked bootloader.  My only gripe is that they are ignoring the aluminum chassis issue with the GPS signal.  This isnt a problem for me because I'll just use GPS Tether if I need to Navigate on my tablet for some god unknown reason.  Besides, the GPS does lock when outside, just not very strong.Apple can make their iPad3 and do whatever they want, but they will never be "mod community friendly" which is a killing point for me and many other people.  I want to do what I want with my item.  If you spend $500 on an item, you should have the freedom to use it as you see fit, which ASUS understands, but Apple ignores.Asus has released two updates since launch, which fixed the issues people were griping about on Amazon reviews.  So keep them coming, and ASUS will listen.  ICS is coming within a week.  Who else listens this much and gives their consumers what they want?  Even if it's the 10% or so that do want something fixed.I've had no hiccups, or any significant problems with this things.  After owning the original Transformer TF101, I can say without a doubt, they've improved on this in every aspect.  This is the tablet that I will keep for some time.  It does everything I need it to do, and is powerful enough to stand the test of time for every day tasks.	
35	1	0	4	2	4	4	4	0	4	2	4	4	Pleasantly Surprised. With all of the disappointment I've been reading in other reviews, I expected a letdown when I received my Prime.  However, it has been great.  The UI is snappy, the wireless range is perfectly fine, there are plenty of apps (many mentioned limited availability of apps on Honeycomb, I have yet to not find something I need/want), and the charging takes as long as I expected it to.This is a good, solid product.  I think some people are looking for absolute perfection, and I'm just looking for something that works damn well.  The Prime clears that bar easily in my opinion.The one thing that I am disappointed in (that I did not see mentioned in any other review) is the lack of 5 GHz wireless N.  It supports 2.4 GHz, but not 5 GHz.  From what I've read, the hardware supports it, but ASUS has disabled it in software.  This could be due to the aluminum case, but I do have 5 GHz N deployed in my home, so it would have been nice to use it.  That being said, now that ASUS has announced that they will provide a bootloader unlocking utility, I'm sure CyanogenMod 9 will make 5 GHz wireless N available, regardless of range.	
36	2	0	4	3	4	4	4	3	0	1	3	3	Impressive tablet. I'd give it a 5, except for the short WiFi range. It gets a good signal when close but drops off quickly if more than 15-20 feet away from source.Solid design, incredible performance.	
37	4	4	0	0	3	4	0	1	4	0	4	3	Excellent tablet for a regular user. I find the Asus Transformer Prime TF201 (32GB) to be an excellent product for what it was designed to be: A consumer tablet. Note: It is not a notebook or full slate computer. I will provide a review on what I needed a tablet for: an eReader for books and journal article PDFs, a way to do light work (minor document editing and posts to online classrooms) when travelling, surfing the web at home, watching videos, and playing games now and then.Because the tablet has been reviewed fairly extensively, I will just address the highpoints and issues others have experienced. I am running Android version 4.0.3 (ICS) and it is pretty flawless so far (this udpate happened automatically when I first charged the tablet and took about 10 minutes). I don't know or care about the bootloader issue others have reported on. The only thing I noticed is that I cannot delete the stock photos in the gallery.Screen and Resolution - Bright, vivid, awesome HD graphics, and smooth scrolling between panes/screens. No defects in screen or resolution (no light bleed). Glass picks up finger prints but very easy to clean and not really noticable whne screen is on. Gorilla glass seems pretty hard, so hopefully will never scratch with proper care and a case.WiFi - no problems whatsoever. Signal is pretty good several floors from router and has not dropped. My tablet works as well as all my other wireless devices. The signal strength indicator does vary from 10-52 Mbps depending on where you are, but it never has any trouble downloading at regular speeds. My expereince has been that the WiFi on the tablet works fine, but could probably be better for those with weak signals.Browser - The Asus browser works great! Loads as fast as any other WiFi computers on my 54 Mbps wireless(but slightly slower than hard-wired broadband computers, of course). I prefer the functionality of non-Mobile sites for Netflix and Rotten Tomatoes, so glad I can access these sites with a regular browser rather than a stripped-down App. Access is fast and trouble-free to all the major sites I have visited. I have encountered only a very few "browser not responding" boxes when loadig large pages, but as soon as you click "Wait" the page is immediately loaded and there have been no real "crashes" to report.eReader - Using Kindle and MyLibrary apps, books and PDFs open and scroll fine. One exception is that I can't open password-protected PDFs...seems to be a ProQuest ezproxy compatibility issue with Android OS and not the fault of the tablet per se.Apps - Have downloaded about 20 and all seem to work fine. No crashes.Battery life - It goes through about 10% an hour with moderate use and "balanced mode" selected. I got 11.5 hours on first full day of usage and still had 10% battery left when I shut down. very hapy with battery life. The keyboard dock battery should extend this to 16 hours - very nice!GPS - Did not buy for this feature, but it works fine with WiFi on or off. Inside or outside of house makes no difference either. Accurate to within 10-15 feet and updates in real time with your movements.I have not yet received the keyboard dock yet, so I can't comment on that, but I hope that it allows for easier full screen viewing while typing. The Asus keyboard works fine for an on-screen keyboard (certainly easier than using the one on my android phone!) and does not have any noticeable lag (but I am not a speed typist by any stretch of the imagination!).One thing I did not anticipate is how hard it is to hold with one hand for extended periods of time. It is not heavy, but it is thin and the back is not textured enough to provide good grip. I have ordered a case that should make one-handed reading easier and also converts for desktop stand use.Overall I feel this is an excellent tablet.	
38	1	0	4	0	2	2	0	1	1	1	0	0	Washed out screen due to backlight bleeding. I purchased this item and waited several weeks for it to arrive from Amazon.  I received it today only to turn it on and be immediately taken aback by the amount of backlight bleeding from the LCD screen.  There were spots on the screen that were washed out and yellow due to the amount of backlight improperly washing out specific areas of the screen.  The level of frustration I have right now is pretty astounding.  This is a hot ticket item that everyone's been waiting for and this is what I get?  Asus clearly doesn't care about quality control which is tantamount when they're only shipping these out in VERY small batches.  I'm very disappointed.  I didn't even make it to the home screen before I repackaged it and came to the site for an RMA.  I cancelled my order for the keyboard dock and quite frankly I'm never ordering from Asus again.  First they make you wait, then they give you over-priced, poorly constructed garbage.  It's too bad they don't QA the products they send to us the way they QA the products they send to magazines, tech sites and popular youtube review channels.	
39	0	2	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	0	4	4	Don't see the problem. I recently received my Prime, and am happy to report that it runs every game(Including Shadowgun) smooth as silk. I faced none of the dreaded crashes after the ICS update. The battery life is great, even running games regularly it lasts for a couple days on a single charge. It truly is the best tablet on the market today. No WiFi issues that i have noticed, it actually gets better signal than my iTouch. Haven't tried the gps function yet, but if i wanted to have help navigating around my house, i would have bought a dedicated device. There were some delays in my order, but i contacted Amazon and they were eager to correct the issue and it (the Prime) was shipped the next day	
40	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	4	4	1	4	4	Great Tablet. I was worried after reading all the reviews and maybe just lucky - but my Transformer Prime is fantastic. I have not used the GPS and do not care about this feature. The wireless access is fine. The tablet updated at once to Ice Cream Sandwich. I also have the keyboard and the combination is great. I am hoping to get them for my whole office staff.	
41	0	3	2	4	2	4	0	0	0	0	1	4	A Deal Breaker for me. Different people use a tablet for different purposes. Therefore they form different opinions about the tablet. Please note that if you don't use ASUS Transformer Prime to watch high resolution HD movies but just for other usages, this review should not affect your purchase decision.I have waited for a long time to buy an ASUS Prime (TF201). I have done extensive market research. To my dismay, it was out of stock with Amazon in the first two weeks of 2012, though there were quite a few from third parties with much higher prices. During those weeks, I kept logging on Amazon several times in a day just to check if there would be any ASUS Transformer Prime available. On 1/20/2012, to my pleasant surprise, suddenly a handful of ASUS Prime units became available from Amazon. I was so excited that I quickly snatched the opportunity to order one for myself. I had very high hope with the ASUS Prime based on so many positive reviews that I've read. I am sure it has many great features and most of them are the best in the industry. But I also had a little concern about one thing, the color of the HD video that the Prime plays. I use a tablet mostly to watch HD movies with resolution of 720P (1280x720). Most reviews seem to be focused on its superior build quality, being thin and light, high processing speed, and screen brightness etc, but very little mentioning of the quality of color. Only one review from CNET website has brief mentioning that the reviewer said that he was more impressed by Samsung Galaxy's image color compared to ASUS Prime. That information concerned me. But I still ordered it from Amazon just to give it try. After I received it on 1/23 and tested it, my concern about the Prime's video color proved to be true. I use an app called MX Video Player downloaded from Android Market to play 720P movies in formats of MKV, MP4 and AVI on the Android tablet. Before I bought ASUS Transformer Prime, I had bought two tablets, Ipad2 and Samsung Galaxy 7.7. IPad2 is a great tablet, except that Ipad2 has weaknesses with its screen resolution and the video color. That's why I bought the Samsung Galaxy 7.7 later on to make up for it. Samsung Galaxy 7.7 is still not available in the US market yet. I ordered from a retailer in Singapore. The image quality and screen color of the HD movies of the Galaxy 7.7 are absolutely stunning. I haven't seen any tablet better than Galaxy 7.7 in terms of that.The screen of the ASUS Prime is very bright, as many reviewers have said. However, the color of the 720P video being played on ASUS Transformer Prime is very pale. The ASUS Prime seems to have diminished large amount of colors, most noticeably the redness. The colors of wallpaper and photos from the internet browser have no such problem. They look very good. I noticed the lack of colors only when watching 720P HD movies or TV shows. I was disappointed and I returned it to Amazon the next day. I would wait for the Samsung Galaxy 11.6 coming out later in this year. When it comes to the color richness, Samsung products (TV and tablet) seem second to none. I heard Samsung makes screens for many other brands including Ipad. Perhaps they have held some technology related to the screen color to themselves and use it exclusively to their Samsung Galaxy tablet.	
42	0	4	1	4	0	4	4	0	4	1	2	4	Be real. Be real. If you only want to play games and you are an adult why waste your hard earned money. The original asus transformer is great. After all a tablet is a tool for purposes of productivity and surfing the net for useful information or even watching movies. I don't see why so many people are waiting for the prime. Truth is I have the prime but honestly it is no better than the original transformer. Who cares whether it is quad core or whatever. Don't fall victim to clever marketing about how well the games will look. It's your ability not the processor that will improve your performance.  I am returning mine since I received it as a gift. No issues with the gps or wi-fi on my original. I know lot of you are going to disagree with me. But if you want bad wi-fi, terrible gps and lest I forget an easy to scratch case, be my guest. Those of you who own both know exactly what I am talking about. Just hope this alleviates some of you from the frustration of waiting and waiting for something you think will be better.	
43	0	4	4	3	0	4	4	0	2	1	4	4	Great device. After some hesitation due to the negative reports on wi-fi and Gps I decided to purchase the TF Prime. I've had the tablet for about 4 days now, and it has exceeded my expectations. Concerning the wi-fi issue I have tested with two different routers and compared to an android phone that has excellent reception. Using a wi-fi analyzer I was able to determine that the other device had slightly better reception, but not to a point of affecting performance. At a distance of more than fifty feet from the router and several rooms signal strength basically matched the phone. It appears to be a non-issue for me. GPS also works fine. I purchased the keyboard dock, which is necessary for how I am using the tablet and am very happy with it.I intend to use the Prime primarily for work using Citrix Xenapp. I downloaded the beta version of Citrix receiver for android, and have been more than pleased with performance. Applications launch seamlessly and render correctly. In a nutshell don't believe all the negative reports. I'm sure people have had problems, but it appears Asus is working hard on resolving them. The tablet is hard to come by, but in my opinion worth the effort and wait.	
44	3	4	4	4	0	1	0	4	4	1	4	4	I love this tablet!!!  The only way I would give it up is if you pried it from my cold dead hands!!!! I received my tablet on Thursday of last week and since then we have been inseparable.  As soon as I received it I pulled it out plugged it into the docking keyboard and attached it to the charger.  I turned it on and put in my account info and it immediately found my wifi with no problem and it had full signal anywhere in my four floor house with my router in the basement.  I was also able to take it a good distance from my house and the wifi is fine.  I went to a local Starbucks and the wifi picked up on their network well also.  I did all of this wilh the standard Android Honeycomb 3.2 that came on it before running the update to ICS that I was prompted to install.  Notice that I did not even test GPS before running the upgrade because whether GPS works or not is a mute point for me.  I use my droid with car dock for GPS if I need it and will not use this for that purpose.  Incidentally, the Mapquest app in the market works better with the turn by turn navigation than even the stock navigation.  I was prompted to run the system update that brought me up to download and install ICS 4.0 and it works extremely well in all the apps that I have used.  My games move well and do not lock up, except for the occasional software bug associated with the app itself.  This is a definite buy for anyone who isn't willing to settle for Apple's piece of crap iPad 2 or 3 when it comes out.  The speed and performance of this tablet is amazing.  For those of you shying away because you know they are coming out with the tf700 model save your money and buy this it works great for me and it will for you too.

Besides, you can add more space by adding MicroSDHC chips of up to 64 GB each - I did not try the 128 GB version yet (up to two extra chips with the extra keyboard). So memory can be up to 196 GB. There is a USB connection on the keyboard, and on the screen itself a Micro-HDMI connection.. All these you don't have on an iPad.. It misses an internet connection "on the road" -  but my iPad had very bad connections anyhow (I live in West LA).	
46	4	3	4	0	0	0	2	4	1	1	4	4	My ASUS TF201 Prime is okay..... I read all I could before ordering last month and am happy to report mine has had no issues. ICS loaded problem free, the Wi-Fi and GPS work fine anywhere I've tried in my house. The battery life is very good as well. It will not replace my laptop or desktop for inputing to the internet as a larger screen size and a real keyboard makes that task easier. Once you do have your favorite web sites loaded into the tablet though it's easier to navigate around with the GUI interface and just finger swipes. There are lots of apps available to chose from that are both fun, useful and informative. They load quickly and are fast and ready to use with their own icons. If I had to chose between a laptop or tablet strickly for versitility and productivity I'd still pick a laptop but the tablet interface makes it quicker to navigate and to checkout your favorite web sites with finger tip swipes in half the time while enjoying a morning cup of coffee. The unit works for me but then I tend be a moderate techno junkie so I'll keep this tablet and continue to enjoy what it does best. I purchased a cover that allows the tablet to stand up at different angles which makes it easier to use by freeing up your hands, also added a 32GB class 10 micro-SD storage card.	
47	0	2	3	4	4	0	2	0	4	2	2	1	What WiFi? I bought my Asus Jan 7th of this year and noticed improvements with each up date but the WiFi connection never got any better.Yes, I tried 4 different routers in different locations but the signal was always weak unless I was within 20 feet of router.Just recently, my AC adapters USB port broke.  Took me almost an hour with Asus trying to get an RMA to replace.  When you getthe right person who knows what he is doing, your good to go, but until then, you sit on hold and wait for the wrong departmentto answer.  I had the Asus TF101 and had to return it for defects and now I am sending my TF201 back for the common WiFi issuewhich seems to the interference caused by the back cover.Next tablet will be an Ipad.  As a mac user, I swear by the quality but they are expensive.	
48	2	2	3	4	2	4	4	0	0	1	4	3	Does what it is supposed to do. It arrived quickly and the quality is good. It is slightly heavy, but I guess that is because it covers both front and back of the tablet, unlike iPad covers that just cover the front.	
49	4	4	0	0	3	4	1	1	0	0	4	4	I am in Love! I've had the 3rd & 4th generation ipod touches for a while now and as much as I enjoyed them I've always had minor complaints about them due to it's restrictive OS. My wife has an Ipad and I've used it to but not much. It works the same as an ipod touch so this all relates. Using an itouch, if you will, at least without an app you can't hide apps, edit music or video files, have flash support for webpages or just browse files. All of which you can do with my Android operated ASUS Transformer! It's little things like that that make me love this thing. What else do I love? Um...the resolution. Having a Tegre 3 processor, you can watch some very high definition movies on it. I have a bluray ripped Avatar movie that looks so damn clear I swear it looks like bluray on my tablet. I don't know if it's just as good but I do know it sure is pretty. Already I've downloaded over 200 apps on this thing and if I don't have the live wallpaper running and I don't have more than 10 apps running at a time, this guy runs smooth as butter. Don't get me started on the Live Wallpaper. If you want to impress your friends real quick, download Koi Live Wallpaper. While on the home screen you can see very realistic fish swimming in water under your icons while rain drips in the water and watch your friends jaws drop when the fishes swim away from your finger when you touch the screen. (You're welcome Kittehface Software for the plug ) Before buying this thing the only problem I've seen people having with it is it's wifi speed. I'm not a real big technical nerd and the wifi I have available where I'm at sucks as it is so I can't really say much about it other than it works good enough for me. Some might not realize this but if you get the keyboard docking station, there's a USB slot on the docking station so that you can hook up your external hard drive to it and an XBOX controller for a lot of games that support it. NOW! for my most beloved feature/ability of this thing. The ability to download and play SNES, N64 and Playstation games through emulators available on the Android Market aka Google Play. I don't know about getting roms from the apps because I've always had the roms on my hard drive but the emulators all work well with a controller. I really liked my ipod touches a lot but I love this thing so much I would marry it if I could and if I was single. I do love my wife a lot more though.	
50	0	2	1	4	3	4	0	0	0	4	4	4	No regrets! First off, I got the Prime because I wanted a tablet and didn't want an iPad. So I did some research and it looked like the prime was the proverbial "next best thing." Once it arrived I was impressed right out of the box. I have had it for a few weeks now, and I can say I regret nothing. The TF300 came out right after I ordered it for a hundy less, and looks like, if you are willing to make sacrifices in the storage and display dept., a pretty good deal. But back to the TransPrime. The display is remarkable. The form factor is comfortable and gorgeous, even though there are a few changes I'd make (power button placement being #1). The sound is some of the best I've heard on a portable device, crisp and clear. The tab comes with ASUS WebStorage (8GB free) and being an Android device you also have access to the Google Drive Cloud (another free 8 GB). So if you have a WiFi signal you'll be money in the drive department. Speaking of, a lot of people gripe about the metal back and connectivity issues. I've had none, so far but ASUS will throw in a GPS dongle pro bono. In the case I bought for it, it's about the size of a Harry Potter Hardcover and half the depth, so if you can carry a book with you you can carry the tablet. I would recommend it (or the TF300) to any tablet shoppers.	
51	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	ASUS Tablet was the perfect choice. I bought this for work, and looked at all tablets (including iPads). First I set $500 as my cap, but moved it to $700 to include and compare more tablets and more options. Purchased this for $600 (I think it was $614 including tax, 2 day shipping, etc).I'm not a fan of smart phones. I use my phone (a lot) for business, but texts, calls, conference calls, GPS and camera are all I need and want in a phone, and my (non)smart phone does all those things better than most smart phones AND the battery lasts 10X longer than a smart phone. But my business sometimes requires me to have email access also when I'm out of the office. I'm 55, don't like wearing reading glasses, so I decided to get the largest, clearest, easiest smart phone I could get... and this tablet was it.It's awesome. The battery is great, lasts much longer than my partner's smart phone battery. The screen is large and clear. I can easily type on the touch screen with my fat fingers, etc. I've only had it a couple months but I do use it quite a bit and like it. I thought I'd resist it as much as I resist smartphones, but I don't. I use it and like it. Never hangs, easy to use, quick boot, large clear screen, light, thin.Great investment. I'd buy it again for sure.	
52	3	0	4	4	1	0	4	1	0	0	2	4	Almost Delivers on It's Promises. Asus markets the Transformer Prime as the ultimate Android tablet...and it almost is.  My experience mirrors precisely that of many of the reviewers here:Pros:  Sleek size; beautiful design; blazingly fast processor; Android ICS; optional keyboardCons:  Wi-Fi reception is marginal at best, pitiful beyond a certain distance from the wireless router.  My laptop (also an Asus) gets good reception on my 2nd story deck (router is downstairs), while my Transformer cannot hold onto the signal; speaker is often not loud enough for some video/audio stuff, while some sites are OK (YouTube); 2 dead pixels on display; no GPS signal, even outside.  I haven't yet ordered the free GPS dongle from Asus.Overall, I am fairly pleased with my purchase, though I wanted to be "wowed".  I was hoping the complaints were overblown, but they are not.  This could have been the iPad equal, but not quite.  I still prefer Android, so I'll stick with it.  Hopefully Asus will get it right with the next generation.	
53	3	0	1	4	4	0	0	4	1	4	3	3	Asus Transformer Prime T201. I purchased this in March, I previously owned an Apple IPAD 2 and hated it.  I haven't used this tablet alot and find that some things are difficult to do on the tablet but I am getting better with it.  I first owned the HP tablet and loved it but when I found out that they were discontinuing the product I returned it for credit.  I do like the Prime better than the IPAD and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star yet I need to use it more.  I would recommend it.	
54	0	0	1	0	0	1	4	4	4	4	0	0	Piece of junk. After 2 months the TF201 would not turn on. There are many people having the same issue. ASUS said they would fix it, but I would have to pay to send it back to them. So much for customer service. This unit should be re-called. Amazon was good about taking it back as a return, but charged me $100 "restocking fee" that they neglected to inform me of prior. I will be contacting Amazon about the charge. If I were you, I would look at a different tablet then this one.	
55	0	3	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	2	3	2	gps WHERE ARE YOU?  OH WiFi your back. It would be 5 stars if the GPS worked and the wifi wouldn't turn off a couple times a day. No response from ASUS????	
56	0	0	0	4	1	4	1	0	4	4	1	1	Nice pad but Asus service is worthless. I purchased my Transformer Prime 4 months ago.  I have greatly enjoyed using it.  However, there are huge problems.  First, forget about Asus giving support.  I am unable to get the docking station to do anything beyond actually dock.  The keyboard does nothing.  The charging will charge the docking station but not the tablet itself.  So in other words the docking station becomes just one more thing sitting on my desk with absolutely no value.  I called for support and got a person who was not only rude but there were two people arguing so loudly in the background I had to constantly ask that he repeat himself, only to have him finally tell me that I would need to do a complete backup of the system. (He told me he was not allowed to tell me how to do that)  He then told me after I had magically and mysteriously without his assistance found out how to make a complete back up I should tell the tablet to reset itself to the factory settings.  However, he was honest enough to tell me he had no idea if that would actually work but it was a good try.I then wrote for support.  The answer I got was to direct me to a webpage that was entitled Transformer Prime but had absolutely nothing to do with an android system but was entirely windows system based.  No help at all, and further requests for help have been answered.And then there is the charging system that is made up of pins that bend and keep me from being able to charge the tablet without taking a needle and straighten the pins again, and again, and again.It is a fascinating toy for my grandchildren and for playing solitaire and even as a camera.  However, beyond that I cannot even imagine what I could possibly use it for.	
57	4	4	4	0	0	1	0	4	1	0	3	2	One of the Better Novelty Tablets. I'm not slamming this tablet.  I'm just pointing out some flaws of most tablets for those that may not know what they're getting themselves into.It's one of the better tablets out there but tablets are still a novelty item.  They have their uses but they definitely aren't notebook replacements and have a place where you don't want to wield a notebook.  Overall it's a good addition to my device collection but my Dell Inspiron Duo provides a better "real web" experience because it has a real desktop OS.  The color doesn't look gray to me but what a champagne would look like.  I've never seen a champagne in person and I've verified the model numbers in store as well and they say gray.I've used the Android OS since the HTC G1 came out and have every major version up through 4.x.  Once mobile Flash was finally introduced, pocket web browsing became a much better experience.  The worst thing about stock Android is they never fixed their e-mail client (no, I don't use their gmail and use an ISP) and it still has the same basic problems since the beginning.  They obviously don't care since they want you to use gmail.The apple crowd have it worse with the lack of flash support but everyone hates being redirected to a mobile site when they've paid good money on a capable machine.  Changing the UserAgent usually doesn't work much these days.  Some sites provide you the option to go to the full site but many don't.  And some sites want you to download a stupid application for a web site.  Hmmm, I just want one web browser for every web site I visit, not an application for every web site I would visit.  I don't need the appcrap kind sir.  The googletv falls into this category as well.I also don't enjoying going to YouTube and getting a notification that the video is not allowed to play on my mobile device.  It's bad enough we get notifications that the video isn't allowed in your country.  Some streaming web sites will also give you the 'no mobile devices allowed'.And the applications.  Everything I ever downloaded for the Android platform has been free and I like it that way.  Maybe I deserve what I get for not paying for the full version but I'm sure that's not the case.  One size does not fit all...installer beware.  Because of the splintering between manufacturers and wireless carries (talking versions) on all these mobile devices, not everything works the way it should or even at all.  The same goes for OS updates.  If you're on a telephone then you're pretty much at the mercy of your wireless provider and what they determine the shelf life of your 3-6 month product.  Good luck getting updates up through your 2 year plan.  Tablets are another story if they're WiFi only models.  Good luck with the vendor.  At least Asus has been okay thus far but I'm sure we've seen the better days of updates.  What if Microsoft didn't provide you Windows Updates after owning your shiny new Packard Bell for 9 months?Oh how I hate virtual keyboards for anything more than inputting passwords....Complex passwords?  Fugetaboutit!!  I picked up the keyboard for this and it's a lifesaver for typing.  I'd like to see Microsoft Surface users enjoying their spreadsheets with a touchscreen.  I'm looking forward to the Surface platform because if it solves the issues I state above, so long Android.Life's Connected Rules:You shouldn't tote around any mobile telephone with a screen size larger than 4".  That's why you have tablets.You shouldn't carry around a tablet with a screen size larger than 10".

58	0	0	0	2	0	4	4	4	4	2	0	0	Terrible. I've had this tablet since late January and it's slowly becomming worse and worse as time goes on. I constantly get lag and it freezes every few minutes with just simple web browsing. The wifi is also horrible on this unit, when at a hotel it won't even keep a stable connection unless your room is literraly right next to the wifi router.It's gotten so bad that I don't even really touch it anymore. I will never buy another Asus product again. Terrible product quality and customer service. They even replaced this unit in less than a year with the TF700 which means fewer updates and support for the TF201 Transformer Prime. They basically left all of us who bought this tablet out $600 with a tablet that does not work as advertised.This is my first and probably my last review as an amazon customer of over 10 years. This tablet is just that BAD. Stay away and don't make the same mistake I did.	
59	4	0	3	0	4	1	1	2	4	4	0	4	Cracked screen. When I first bought this it was the best I could find. I really did my research! The game play was amazeing, the sound decent... I Absolutly loved it. Perfect laptop replacement. Then came a night when I was significantly let down. I was watching utube videos and there was nothing wrong. Absolutly nothing. When it was time to put my children to bed I set my tablet down on the kitchen counter in its docking station where it sits every time it is not in use, and there it stayed for about 30 minutes. Once my duties were done I went to check my emails before going to bed when I noticed a crack in the screen. Not a small scratch, not an unnoticeable crack, but a a hairline crack from the top left corner to the bottom right. I had done nothing wrong to damage the tablet. I have investigated this issue and there are numerous complaints on numerous web sites, including androids own web site. After three weeks of waiting for them to locatate the tablet that had arrived three days after I sent it in I was told that I would need to pay an extra $200 to fix the issue. So if you have the extra money to dish out everytime the screen decides to break for absolutY no reason this is the tablet for you! Other than that it works great.	
60	3	2	0	4	1	2	1	2	4	1	3	4	Almost perfect. Ever since its purchase, I have been singing the praises of the transformer prime. I agree with every good thing said here. HOWEVER, I cant quite give it 5 stars because the connectivity has been very poor for me. If I sit upstairs in my bedroom, I can get wi-fi on my laptop, my cell phone...even my husbands ipad. However the signal is very inconsistent and sometimes absent on the transformer prime. Outside of that, I'm happy.	
61	0	4	0	0	4	1	2	4	4	0	0	0	Worst tablet and customer service I've ever experienced. I don't normally write reviews. Most products are not good or bad enough for me to care. This is honestly the worst experience I have ever had with a product. My need for a laptop replacement for college is the only reason it wasn't immediately returned.The short version: don't buy it. The customer service is worthless and the quality control is nonexistent. Go buy a Nexus 10 or something else from Samsung.PROS: None. There isn't a single good thing I can say about this tablet that matters at all to me. The closest I can come is that it's a nice looking paperweight. But honestly, looks are only a pro if it works. Otherwise, who cares?CONS: This one needs categories  BEFORE REPAIR TABLET: The tablet itself was glitchy from day one.  GPS: Like everyone else has said, they suck. The GPS, I can deal with. I wasn't really planning on using it much for that purpose. That said, if you advertise a feature, that feature had better work. If I buy a tablet that advertises GPS, I want to be able to use it whether that's its main purpose or not. The GPS dongle that was ASUS's fix is ugly and prevents the use of the dock, which was a big selling point for the tablet. Before repair, the dongle failed to improve the GPS. It still could never get a lock.  WIFI: Again, it's as bad as everyone has said. I had read that some people had decent signal strength. Mine did not.  GRAPHICS: This was one of the biggest problems. It never could render the graphics properly. Anything displayed on the screen was distorted and shaded oddly. Instead of smooth shading, there were only a few very noticeable breaks where the shading changed. Everything had distorted edges. If I were to guess, I would say the graphics processor was damaged or was not properly attached. This was the one of the reasons I originally sent it in for repair.  FREEZING: This was the other big problem. This thing has a quad-core processor. It had more processing power than the broken laptop it was replacing. It had more than enough power to run everything perfectly smoothly as advertised. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. It constantly froze on the simplest tasks. Browsing the internet wasn't possible through either the stock browser or any Play Store replacements. The tablet would always stop responding.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: ASUS has the worst customer service period. Honestly, I would get better results from beating my head on a rusty nail. I can't adequately describe how amazingly awful it is. When I first contacted them, they were quick to issue an RMA. That was the only thing they did quickly. The repair center had the tablet for 6 weeks. I had no contact from ASUS about what was going on. Their repair status website had some cryptic code that meant nothing to anyone who didn't work at ASUS. I had no idea what was going on. I honestly think they just dumped it in a corner somewhere and forgot about it. Things finally started moving when I filed a complaint with ASUS. However, they still did not tell me what was going on. They intentionally waited almost 2 more weeks to respond to my complaint after the delivery confirmation informed them I had picked up the tablet. This response actually took me longer than necessary to decipher since they couldn't be bothered to glance over the couple of sentences they wrote. This pathetic example of how NOT to conduct business would have concluded here if the tablet were actually fixed. It was not.  AFTER REPAIR TABLET:  GPS: Without the dongle, the GPS was unimproved, but it works with the dongle now.  WIFI: Wifi is about the same. It will never have perfect signal strength because of the design flaws.  GRAPHICS: The constant bad shading and edges were mostly fixed. I say mostly because while it isn't constantly messed up as before, the graphics still freak out periodically.  FREEZING: The freezing is much, much worse, and it continues to get worse.  TOUCH: This is a new problem since the repair. Many times when I touch the screen, it will react as if I touched a completely different area. It won't always recognize swiping to scroll a page. This is also getting worse.  MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE: Since the repair actually made the tablet worse, I unfortunately was not done dealing with ASUS. Instead of offering a replacement or an advanced RMA, they continued to insist that I send them the tablet again. Surprisingly, I don't trust them any more. After waiting 6 weeks to receive a tablet with more problems than it was sent with, I just don't think this particular tablet is reparable. Since they refused to help, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. I won't give any details from that other than the complaint is still open after 5.5 weeks.If you've made it this far, I should add one more thing. ASUS knew about every one of these problems before they released this model. It was replaced in less than a year by a fixed version, the TF700t, aka the Transformer Pad Infinity. The only difference in specs is a slightly higher resolution screen. The tablets are sold for the same price. Actually, I just checked. Amazon sells the 64 GB version of the TF700t for less than the 64 GB version of the TF201.

63	0	4	1	2	0	4	0	0	4	4	4	4	My Asus Transformer. It keeps a lot of charge after I charged it, it's pretty cool but sometimes it's frozen often, I love it a lot, I got the keyboard every time I'm trying to put them together it won't stick, I won't go harder to break any of the part. Thanks for the Tablet I love it it's cool	
64	4	0	1	0	4	4	1	2	4	0	0	0	Nothing but problems for a year and now broken. Let me start by saying I have been a huge Asus fan for many years, always using their motherboards in my PC builds and being very happy with their performance. I am currently typing on an Asus brand laptop. I was thrilled to be able to own a cutting edge tablet from such a trusted and reliable company. With that out of the way, on to the review of this product:This was supposed to be my and my sons Xmas gift last year, but the pre-order was not filled until a few weeks later in January, so the first experience I had with this product was an annoying wait. After receiving the item and getting used to the interface and doing all the updates I became very concerned about the poor WiFi reception only a room away from my router, and barely usable at the other end of the house in my living room. This not being a problem for any of my gaming consoles/PC's. On top of this there were tons of basic stability issues, especially with the browser. I had not responding messages come up every time I scrolled pages and randomly with most any functions and frequently had to force close. The Play Store is also fairly unusable on the system.I originally thought these were just early issues and they would improve... and they did, somewhat. The not responding issues have gotten better, but are still fairly frequent. I have since gotten an android phone (HTC One VX) and it is so much faster and more stable and fun to use I can't believe what I was missing out on. I pretty much just used the Prime for my son who is 3 and autistic as a therapy and learning device now. Well, up until last week, but I'll get to that.Other problems with the system include 5+ minute boots from the moment I first received the thing, way longer than my PC's take to boot! Also, randomly, it refuses to start and I will think it has finally kicked it, only to have it power on again the next day. Then there is the proprietary charger and the software based charging that often fails to work. Basically I plug the device in and it won't charge. And then another day I try and it will. I think what needs to happen is the power needs to run out completely before the charger is able to work due to the charging software crashing? This is just a guess, but it's quite annoying to tell a young child with autism that the computer isn't working because it doesn't have enough power to boot and it won't charge.Then there are the crashes that cause me to have to restart entirely, usually related to icons refusing to load and the OS basically being frozen. This again has never happened on my phone. On the Prime it could sometimes happen multiple times in one evening. After holding in the power button multiple times it would eventually reset, usually to power back on after a few more power button presses... then load for maybe 8 minutes and then turn right back off. At this point the system would then proceed to get super hot, so hot it would burn your hand to touch it. When attempting to turn it back on in this state, it would just start booting again. This happened often. I was very worried the components were being fried, but I didn't know what to do to keep it from getting hotter and hotter as it happened when the system was off! It never got hot like this when it was on.So after a year of just dealing with my 500 dollar gift barely functioning (was unable to play tons of commercial apps I tried due to games freezing and rapidly flashing after playing for a few minutes) and never once dropping or abusing the system (not a slight scratch or mark anywhere on the thing), the screen broke. While against the side of my couch sitting next to me while I used my DS. My son was in bed and I had just used it to check my email. I wanted to try to play a quick round of scramble before bed and picked it up to use it and saw what looked like something white on the screen. Having a not so smart moment I touched it to see what it was. I still have a piece of glass lodged in my thumb. I am completely unable to determine how the screen could have possibly broken while sitting on the couch next to me. I wasn't touching it. I wonder if the system getting so hot sometimes caused a weakness in the glass? I really have no clue, but we can't afford another right now and my son who is very set in routines and who loves the thing has been miserable all weak. I am afraid to just tape it and let him play with it as the cracking could become worse. It's a very odd pattern, like it got crushed in one area, as if someone had taken say a screwdriver and just drove it down to the corner of the screen.So anyway, long story short, this item has been a giant string of problems and disappointments and now I have to find it in the budget to find another tablet for my son so that he can continue to benefit from what the technology offers him. I can honestly say I will never buy another Asus product again, 500 dollars is a lot for a single income family, I am not currently able to work as I take care of my son and we have tons of therapies to pay for each week and drive him to. Really did not need this problem on top of everything, but that's life. One unhappy customer may not mean a lot to Asus, but a product like this with so many negative reviews is sure to make others think twice before buying from then.We had actually been considering a Nexus 7 for my sons birthday, but I'll be looking at another brand now, especially as that tablet was also full of early problems. Don't release products before they are ready Asus, it really has affected your reputation.Edit: Just remembered 2 other problems. The camera is broken, not sure how long as I really didn't use it, but a few months ago when I went to use it it was just a green screen and hasn't worked since. Also since summer, the screen won't rotate into portrait mode anymore on the desktop and a few other times when it should, but will rotate fine in games that support rotation and accelerometer games play fine. No idea.Another Edit: The tablet no longer charges properly at all, it will only "trickle charge". Basically it takes about 24 hours to charge the thing up and an hour or two to use up the charge. It's become my sons tablet as I can no longer be bothered with it and the battery issue at least serves to keep him from using it too much.

I read the reviews before I purchased this item and noted that some people were not happy with the internet connection , but I figured....how bad could it be? Well, It's bad. My wireless router is in the next room and I can barely get one bar.At first I thought maybe it was the router, even though it is brand new, but when I tried it with my laptop I got full bars. So I'm not very happy about that because I have to be in the same room as the router to get a good connection. For the money I have spent on this product , I expected better.Other than that, it's great. Easy to use for a non-techie like myself - love the kindle app which is great to read my books. Graphics are superb. Very disappointed about the internet thing.

The workers are polite, and nice enough and very intuitive, the best I have ever seen from a company. The issue was with the company itself, I had unlocked the boot loader with the program provided by asus for this tablet but did nothing else except a few apps from google play, other than that it was stock. I had removed the apps and wanted to get back to factory reset, so I booted in "safe mode" and performed the reset from there, and the tablet never booted again, well it turns on to the asus logo and goes no farther.This happened because the update and / or rom for jelly bean was installed without a recovery. These updates and rom were stock and came from asus. So the option was there, but no dice. I called Asus and set up to have it fixed (reinstall) but the worker who dealt with a very angry customer did not give me a quote. I called back to get a quote and I asked what the repair ticket said was the issue, He replied "customer broke the bootloader when they unlocked it". This was false, the tablet worked after the bootloader was unlocked. I corrected him and got the quote, 300+ dollars + shipping just to reinstall OS.This was a mistake by asus and they wanted to charge me 300+ dollars! no way! I will never buy another asus product again.	
70	0	0	0	0	4	4	1	4	3	0	0	0	slow performance and poor customer service. I bought it because I was impressed about the announcement that it would be better and stronger than the IPAD. But even though it has the stronger chip, The Apple just starts up way faster and is running more stable. Also since the beginning the GPS was very weak. I knew it was a known issue and was following the blog for 6 months until I Thought there will not be any resolution. I was Informed via my Epad on Jan 2014 that there is a solution but contacting ASUS. I was told the action was only available until August 2013 (note, I was informed in 2014) The answer was its an interesting case but nothing ASUS can do.If you are on the edge between ASUS and Apple, go for Apple. Customer Service there is great and product more stable. I even had an Iphone replaced because of water issues that was my fault, no issues!

I am actually contemplating returning the unit, it has a bright spot of light about 1/4" wide on the screen in the left center of screen like the tft screen is worn away there, so starting off with a defect. I come pre-biassed because I bought a Asus EEE Transformer Honeycomb tablet and ordered the base laptop for it. I was online and saw this, because I could not justify spending almost $600 on a tablet + base so I was going to return the ASUS. However after comparing the 2 I have to say the ASUS wins hands down. The ASUS is only $399 (without base), this one is $349. I do not like Honeycomb and thought I would get a tablet with Froyo but the ASUS screen is SO MUCH MORE CRISP. I will say the screen is very crisp and has VERY wide viewing angles on the Le Pan, but any video I play I see pixilation and bluryness as the processor is not a dual core. The quality of the resolution on the Le Pan is not as good. I do have a fast N connection and get better video on other tablets. The ASUS pad has it's own issues with video and I hate Honeycomb so far, but I cannot justify spending $50 less and getting a tablet (Le Pan) that is NOT widescreen (9.7) 4:3 ratio and so far has no real history or support. I dont want to be stuck with a tablet that 6 months down the road, the company will not exist or support updates. I will say the unit does play Angry Birds well, so other games should not be a issue. As others have said Netflix does not play out of the box. The few things this tablet has going for it, is long battery life, GREAT viewing angles, it DOES fit most generic ipad cases very well and it is fairly light with good build quality. I dont know why they chose to put the charger port at the top of the unit though. Overall the unit is good if you just want something that works and fairly good quality that mimics the ipad shape. I however think I will stick with the more known companies products right now.	
72	3	0	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	A bigger version of my HTC Android cellphone. I've been using the Le Pan tablet for about 3-weeks now.  First off, I have an HTC Evo cellphone that runs Android 2.2.  And this Le Pan runs Android 2.2.  So right out of the gate I was pretty familiar with how to run this Tablet.  But, Android 2.2 is not really designed for use in tablets (there is a newer version of Android designed for use by tables).  So for Android 2.2, not all Apps work well on the table; examples:  Words With Friends is not usable on my tablet and I haven't figured out how to adjust it (the bottom few rows are cutoff on the tablet screen), my son reports some of his app games don't work on the tablet, but luckily for my son all the Angry Bird / Angry Frog / Angry Dad games work great on this Le Pan tablet.In terms of the brand I have never heard of Le Pan.  I even googled their name and there is almost no info out there.  Documentation that comes with the tablet is very sparse as is info on the web.  Maybe the info will increase over time.  This type of info is somewhat important for me because I'd like to know if this tablet will be upgradable to the newer version of Android software designed for tablets.  Also this would help me try to make tweaks/fixes to such things as Words With Friends screen size. +My pros:  Does seem to have good build quality (feels solid), Android Market appears as a standard icon and has been easy for me to download apps, screen display is nice, was easy to get up and running and synch to my home wireless, battery life seems decent, takes micro sd memory card so you can add bigger size. -My cons:  Power Button is very tiny and pain in the butt to turn on and off, sometimes the screen will turn back on for no reason, the 4 Android buttons are backlit but only for a few seconds - so if I'm using this thing in a dimily lit room I can't see where the buttons are and I can't figure out how to adjust the backlight timing (I googled around alot trying to figure this out but no luck), the charging cable is kind of a strange size (would prefer standard usb cellphone charging cable), relatively anonymous company so not sure about future support and info (eg; can I upgrade to newer android software, etc).Now compared to iPad, my friends iPad seems much slicker.  His iPad is faster, screen seems brighter, and everything seems integrated together more.  But then again part of this is just the nature of Apple's closed ecosystem vs Androids open ecosystem.Overall, I give this 3.51 stars (rounds up to 4).  It is a usable tablet, and better to use around the house for me than my Android 2.2 cellphone because the screen is bigger.  But, I deducted 1.49 stars for the cons I mentioned above as well as the fact that at $350 this is a bit pricey in consideration of the cons I listed and other Android options that are out there.  If anything notable occurs subsequent to this review then I'll come back and give an update here.	
73	4	0	3	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	3	3	Passable, good for the price. After having this for some months, it seems a good time to update the review.The Le Pan works okay as a reader and as a browser if you are close to your wifi and i have been able to get Skype working on it, sort of.The screen size and aspect ratio is quite nice for those apps that are able to use it.There are a few issues1. It does not support Android past 2.2.  This creates other limitations.2. Plan on buying a Map/GPS App if you want to use this feature in situations where wifi is not available.4. The button that locks the display orientation, instead flips it back to a landscape orientation and then locks it.5. The screen blanking function only allows choices from 30 second to 30 minutes, there is no disable. Unlocking takes time, so if you want to use it as a music stand, you probably do not want to set a password or pin to protect it.After the latest software update, all of the above seem to still apply.  But given the price, it can be a good deal.	
74	0	4	4	3	4	3	1	4	4	2	4	4	extremely good tablet. I got le pam earlier today and i cant believe how fast and well built it is. The screen is amazing and everthing works great. They need to sell this for about 350 and it works just as good as android tablets in the stores and the ipad..great tablet.	
75	4	4	3	4	0	4	4	0	4	3	3	4	Great price, slightly slower than Ipad, battery life is poor, but totally worth it. I've just got it and tested over the weekend, here are the issues.  I have an Ipad2 before I bought this.  I intend it to be used for watchin movies and for my kid to pay with.Negatives:1.  Not many accessories to choose from.2.  Battery life is not good compared to the Ipad 2.3.  Slower when playing movies, and sometimes there are hiccups if you touch the screen during playback.4.  A bit heavier than Ipad.  about 20% heavier.Positives1.  Android system, easy to get apps, and download movies directly to the Tablet without Itunes.2.  Price, and if you plan on using it less than 4 hrs a day, battery is ok.3.  Expandable Memory cards! Micro SD4.  Overall price/performance is better than IPAD2

Out of over 100 reviews only 7 at the time were rated 1 or 2 stars so we thought the odds of getting a defective tablet was low. We were wrong. The day we received it we turned it on and was able to look around in for a little bit and before we even got the chance to plug it in and let it charge it froze up. I contacted their tech support who advised to let it charge overnight and even gave us directions on how to reset it or do a system reboot. After a week of constantly rebooting every day we decided to return it. I was sad that it didn't work out for us but even if there were no defects I felt the tablet was just a larger version of my android phone and was too practical in my every day life.	
77	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	4	4	cool tablet......worth 200 bucks. This is really nice tablet......faster response......goood screen resolution......good speakers and touchscreen.....no problem with skype......no problem whtsoever.....no bad points found yet......only this is tht it wont upgrade to android 4......but do hell with tht........even day after tomorrow could b android 100.....so dont wxry	
78	3	2	4	0	4	4	4	0	4	4	3	3	Sturdy build quality, would buy over the ipad, everytime. Bought after over 2 months of tablet research, sequence of several tests on different brands and makes at BestBuy, and very heavy focus on application compatibility for 'preemptive' estimation of upgrades/usability.Top reasons for buying:1) Front camera2) Value for money3) Online reviews4) Tests/experiments with other units viz..n00k, k!ndle F!re, Ip@d, s@m$ung G@laxy tab, etcPleasant surprises upon delivery:1) Build quality2) Touch screen responsiveness3) LCD resolutionNot-so-pleasant surprises:1) Weight2) Buggy apps for Android 2.2(not a Le Pan issue)3) Wi-Fi radio strength4) GPS dependent on internet (since its based on google maps navigation, not on the Unified GPS platform used on car GPS devices)*** I refuse to compare this unit with the iPad, since the business model and integration of the 2 are very different ***Ipads are indigenously built by Apple - Software to Hardware to packagingThe android platform is different, since the software is developed by Google (Kudos!), and they have made it so any manufacturer could port it onto a mobile device meeting the minimum hardware requirements. This in itself, is a commendable design, unlike the AppleIOS, which frankly goes bonkers if exposed to unknown hardware. The Android platform handles different hardware  makes pretty  splendidly, obviously with some quirks, as anticipated with any open source software platform.Point is, evaluation of android tablets should be distinct, in that, the hardware and software should be compared separately.Hardware  SoftwareSuperb build quality  Gels beautifully with the Le Pan HardwareChiseled shape, sits well on the palm  Impressively fastSlightly heavy for a wrist pivot over long duration  Buggy versions of apps for 2.2(ex-skype)Power button needs getting used to, not complaint-worthy tho  Incompatible with GoogleHangouts(2.3 onwards works)Brilliant touch screen resolution and responsiveness  Secondary memory read/write is faster than expected4.5 stars to Le Pan for the hardware  3.5 stars to Google for Android 2.2 (4.5 for Honeycomb)Synopsis - Le Pan has a winner here. I paid around $200 for this unit, which is a steal, and I would strongly recommend buying the Le Pan II with 8gigs of internal memory, so you can install more 'frequently used apps' locally, for even faster response.That said, I am delighted to have purchased this unit for $200, and would buy another Le Pan too.PS - If you are not comfortable with upgrading on the android platform, get help from xdadevelopers, but do not get deterred. The Android OS is superior in architecture, and unless you are willing to be hostage to Apple's barricaded eco-system, you are better off with an Android mobile deviceRecommended improvements:1) Newer android version on factory build (Le Pan II has it)2) Changing mic placement to front panel (for better audio feed during video chat)3) Ultra low profile power button, with inward inundation to avoid accidental brush/touch.

Where to start with this is the problem as my wife has been wowed by this early Christmas present; and I have been impressed with it's technical capabilities.On the upside:1) spectacular graphics capability2) fast download and upload speed on our home wi-fi network3) a nice variety of free aps are available at the Android store4) runs NetFlicks even in Canada - it was a painless install that literally took 30 seconds5) responds to touch screen movements as expected6) multiple home pages means you can specialize each one - games, business etc7) comes with gmail installed8) great battery life9) senses amount of light in room and adjusts screen10) can prety well do what an iPad or Blackberry can do11) GREAT value for the priceOn the downside:1) fingerprints on the screen - really what did we expect with a touch screen2) glossy frame and glass screen means lots of reflections3) no owners manual installed or avalable so you need to be a litle bit of a computer geek if you want to customize it - although most activities seem intuitiveWhen I ordered this I also ordered the 32GB microcard as it only comes with 2GB installed.At $169 THIS IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	
80	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	0	0	3	4	LePan TC970 is the best Android 2.2 Tablet for the price. I had been wanting to break into the Android realm for some time but was not ready to trade up my Nokia N8 which still does 90% of what I need from a Smartphone. However, recently while traveling on small prop-jets, I have found that even my 12" Asus netbook is too big for effective use and my N8 is too small for reading eBooks and watching videos. So I asked my wife for the LePan TC970 as a Christmas gift. Has true Google App. Market. Most downloaded apps work without problem. Has built-in wireless 'N' so wifi is fast. Works with the latest version of Skype including video.So far, I have been more than happy.PROS: Amazing price ($179 through Amazon). Great screen display and resolution (1024x768) for full web-pages, photos and videos. Reasonable sound for such a small device. Includes GPS and bluetooth not often found on lower-end devices. Relatively quick and responsive. Capacitive screen works as expected.CONS: Has trouble playing some video file formats. Can not be upgraded beyond Android 2.2 (froyo). Relatively small user base means lack of support compared to other major brands. Skype video is quirky and poor quality.All-in-all, I have to say that this was a great purchase and the LePan TC970 has become my device of choice when I just need to surf, email or play recreationally.	
81	1	2	0	3	3	4	3	4	1	4	0	0	Mic Not working. I ordered one for Christmas everything seem to be ok, but the Mic did not work.  I sent it back for a replacement and the mic did not work on the second one either.  Seems like a little thing but there are some good apps that need voice input.	
82	4	0	3	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	3	4	Christmas gift for our 13 year old son - Very satifisied. Our son was very surprised when he opened this gift as he was asking for an IPod. He uses it all the time, loves it and has downloaded many apps and music. His mother and myself are also thinking of buying ourselves one as well..Very happy!	
83	4	4	1	4	0	4	0	4	1	4	0	0	Constantly freezes! I had the Le pan given to me from my husband for Christmas and in the first hour it froze once. I cont'd to use it the following week thinking maybe it was a glitch....well, the whole thing is a glitch! It constantly froze anywhere from 1-4 times w/in just two hours of simply reading a book on it! I wasn't even trying to surf the web or asking it to do anything difficult for Gods' sake! Needless to say, I returned it and got our money back...what a waste of time and money!	
84	4	4	3	0	4	0	4	4	0	4	4	4	Excellent tablet for the price. I had originally bought this tablet from the Walmart website because it was out of stock on Amazon. It was a birthday present for my husband. I had done a lot of research on tablets before I purchased and the Le Pan seemed like the best performer for the price (I couldn't afford to buy any of the higher range tablets).The tablet that arrived from Walmart was a complete disaster. It was missing the SD card, there was no manual/instructions included and the tablet had obviously been previously handled because it was covered in fingerprints. It performed horribly - constantly needing to be reset. I was very disappointed and returned the tablet to Walmart with the intention of purchasing a different tablet. My husband however had since read Le Pan reviews and was confident that if we tried another one from somewhere else it might be different.So I bought a Le Pan from Amazon and it was like a completely different product. Everything that should be included was there and there have been absolutely no problems with it a month later.My husband is a techie nerd and he loves the Le Pan. Every evening after dinner he settles down on the couch with his tablet and is like a kid with a favourite toy!I have a feeling the tablet I purchased from Walmart was a refurbished model, or perhaps a returned faulty one.	
85	0	3	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	4	4	the le pan tablet it have its ups n downs but itss still the best0. well lets see this tablet iss really great its voted one of the most best android tablets . i had this item for about twoo months i drop it in my dog water bowl soo it did not cut back onn  i got this item  from walmart ..by the way if you buy it from walmart online then print out a reciett it do not matter if you had this  over 30 days cause they can not tell ..all you have to do is go up in say i bought this item of off walmart n it starts to mess up i do not know whats wrong with it n thats all they will check it then they will give you your money backk ..noww i had order me a brand new one of off this web site in i also got this water pruff cass ..this is the same as a ipad i tested both of them in the web speed is the same n its the same sizee ..you should get this onee rightt away :))

87	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	even better than i expected. I have spent weeks looking for the best tablet/e-reader and I feel I made the best choice. yes of course this isn't an ipad but for 200 bucks it is amazing. Because it is to top of the line there are things that cheap people wanting an expensive tablet but not willing to pay for will complain about. I bought two of these one for me for work and play and one for my wife for reading and a recipe book and play. I don't see the need to upgrade to a higher android since this one does what we want it to and more. All we did is install the go launcher app (which allows you to rotate the screen in all directions in all screens) and we could customize it enough for us. We both have our smart phones root so we have our own dedicated hotspot for them. Screen is way clear but I think the recommended screen protector is a must because of finger prints. It feels like the original ipad is a very slick device. I might sound cheesy but I love the tassel that comes with it, it makes me feel more comfortable when I am holding it. Charging is fast and the battery is great. My first charge I installed everything I wanted and watched a full Netflix movie on it before it even hit 20%. I will say that my only issue is the Wi-Fi and it is because if it's on and you don't use it for a bit you have to turn it off and then back on when is not that big of a deal if you download a Wi-Fi toggle off the market place also the volume buttons feel like they are backwards but other than those this is a smooth device especially for the price, all my friends want one now.	
88	4	4	0	0	3	4	4	0	0	4	4	4	Exceeds all my expectations and more! After pre-ordering from Amazon, I had to cancel because waiting time was way too long.  I bought from New Egg last Wednesday and got it on Monday.  After messing with this Le Pan II in last few days, it is just as good as the reviews here said and more.  I have no problem whatsoever the minute I turn on this tablet.  Beautiful screen display.  Everything move swiftly.  It recognize my wifi immediatly and connects with no problems.This is the first tablet I own and really can't believe I bought this baby for less than $300. It does just as good as if not more than those $500+ tablets.  Le Pan will be known in no time.	
89	3	0	3	4	3	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	Excellent Product. I got my Le Pan II less than 24 hours ago and I'm convinced that it's best buy I've ever made. It is decently powerful, and though it's a bit smaller than most of the 10.1" tablets out there, you don't miss the extra real estate. My only complaint is that the 32 pin connector is proprietary, so if I ever lose it I'm out of luck - unless I can modify an iPad connector to fit. Some notes:- The GPS is surprisingly accurate. I had this thing tethered to my HTC Incredible (rooted, installed Cyanogenmod 7 - highly recommend doing this), and when I fired it up while sitting in a parking space at my local Home Depot, the blue arrow was over the exact space I was sitting in. I tried it in a few other spots and it was within a couple of meters every time.- The honeycomb interface is slick. Most apps designed for handsets will scale nicely on honeycomb,and a few seem to know they're on a table and adjust their layout accordingly.- You might as well order the HP slate case that everyone else is getting. You won't find a decent quality case at your local big box stores that fits this unit. Get the screen protector too.- Update 3/5/2012 - Yes, you can use an iPad/iPod connector. On the tablets receptacle for the adapter, there is a small metal tab. You can carefully bend this back. it will only very slightly protrude above the openning, and won't interfere with the connector. You can get data and charge all on the same cord. Android coexisting with iOS technology?- Update 4/6/2012 - After using this tablet for a few months, I am still completely satisfied. It is equally adept at work or play. One quirk I discovered: You can't see certain apps in the android market. This is because while it comes with a Market (or "Play" as it's now called), the makers of the Tablet haven't registered with the open handset alliance. Therefore, they're blocked from downloading apps. The fix for this? You can "side load" apps - eg download them as an APK file, move them onto the tablet and install them that way. You won't be able to get updates from the market for side loaded apps. You'll need to root your tablet, then edit the build.prop file to change the fingerprint of the tablet to something else. This will only affect your market apps, and won't bother anything else. However, you may wind up loading incompatible apps, which can be inconvenient of they cause your tablet to malfunction.	
90	3	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	Le Pan II. I love my le pan ii. Too bad it doesn't play hulu.com since hulu recognizes as a mobile device n wants u to use hulu plus but oh well. Netflix & YouTube apps are awesome. Syncs to gmail just fineNo problems with the wifi as previously discussed. Battery life, use airplane mode when not in use, make sure to not leave it idle. Keyboard response time is excellent. Micro sd slot is plus too! So glad I didn't purchase the Ipad. Just a reminder this is a tablet!	
91	1	3	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	3	3	Recommended for those looking for alternative to expensive tablets. This tablet is just as advertised. Solid for casual users - browsing, email, games, reading eBooks, Skype, music and video. We did not have any issue with Wi-Fi and speed, as reported by some. One star subtracted because of battery (it drains quicker than I expected, and it takes way too long to re-charge).  Camera is also not so good (using it with Skype), but I did not expect anything special.Other than that, Honeycomb is still not as robust operating system and some applications can crash from time to time, but that does not have anything to do with tablet itself.Overall, this is very good alternative for more expensive tablets. For those that are still researching, I can definitely recommend (and by the way, 7 inch tablets are just not big enough, even for casual users).Update (June 14th 2012):Many had problem with this tablet not powering up. I would like to share work-around for that issue, since I experienced it too.Likely cause: It looks that if you leave battery to drain completely, tablet will not be able to charge properly.Effect: As a result of above, tablet appears as dead, even if plugged in chargerWork-around: Use reset button (you will need to use something sharp to press it) to reset tablet while plugged in charger. If needed, unplug and plug charger again.Above works for me, and I can always recover from this issue. Of course, this is kind of annoying, but if you make sure to regularly charge tablet, and not letting it drain completely, it will work just fine. Bottom line is, this is design issue, but I guess it is expected for this kind of product.	
92	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	Good value. I was skeptical about buying an off brand tablet with an old Android version 2.2 but am very happy with my purchase.  Most if not all of the apps I use are compatible with the older Android version.  I considered an iPad but the cost was a lot higher and I was concerned about the greater loss if my young children were to break it.  Speed is good.  Be sure you upgrade to the latest firmware before you do anything else or install programs or data.  Also, I suggest you get a 16GB+ class 10 SD card since the stock card is too small and probably a lower class rating.  I would have purchased the Le Pan II but it was on backorder and I didn't want to wait.  I may purchase another Le Pan 1 or 2 because the kids fight over it and I need another.  Netflix streams fine on our house wifi.  The battery life is ok with about 6 hours on a full charge.  A friend asked if it would run Skype.  I don't use Skype but tested it with him.  The standard video Skype doesn't work but there are hacks you can find that are supposed to work.  I got it partially working but gave up when my friend got a laptop instead.  The camera isn't that good and only front facing but I don't use it.Primary uses: Games (Angry Birds, Where's my Water, for the kids), Movies, eReader (Kindle and Google), web browsing (Dolphin), email, children's educational software (story books, math, reading)	
93	4	4	3	3	2	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	Exactly what I needed. Basically I came out just looking for something to replace my computer and it's broken wireless. Searched through all the tablets and the Le Pan seemed perfect for me and it was! For the price it is amazing, good browsing speed, excellent screen (while most people look at the kindle fire since it's the same price, the screen is personally too small for me), and so glad it has the android operating system.

First let me say I am an Amazon customer, but did not purchase the LE PAN TC 970 from Amazon, however to be fair, i have had it for over a month, it froze a few times, as you will notice from most of the reviewers, but with the reset, it would then work ok.  It would automatically kick itself off my WIFI, but when it worked it was very fast in downloading apps, and web pages.  My son loves Thomas the train, and there is only one Android Thomas app, (no fault of Le Pan) but when you go to the official Thomas website the puzzle game is not optimized for play, so my son gets frustrated with it, and i know it is the android market, because he is able to play those same puzzles on my computer with no problem.  To get to the meat of the matter, you cannot delete an app from the home screen, even after moving it to one of the extended screens, it still sits on the home screen. Well, I hate this thing now, because it stopped working completely this morning! no amount of trying to reset it will make it turn on, so imagine my explaining to my 3 year old, that his tablet is broken, and he will have to go back to his VTECH reader, he took it in good strides, luckily because is dad and I, always tell him these are just "things" they can be gone in a second!Please double think before you purchase, if you want cheap go for this, just be prepared it may be broken and gone after one month!, he never dropped it, and i was right there with him this morning playing his ROARY game when it just went blank.  Of course my 30 days return is up so I cannot return it, and Le Pan's customer service will not be available before Monday.  If you need a tablet for yourself or child, just make a good choice, and proper investment, we paid $250 for it, and still thought it was reasonable, but I guess reasonable is not good enough!!  Will update again, when I call their customer service

With the nice new routers at my house and several friends houses it performs great. The router at work with a T1 and strong signal but older protocol- passable. But several tested Starbucks and McDonalds-- no go after the first time-----Kept trying to get an IP address; fail, and then cycle thru trying over and over. My other two devices and everyone else in the joints had zero problem. Went back home and it was great. Problem-- I need a tablet I can travel with and depend on to get email, directions, reservations, etc. The first order of business for mobile device is connectability to the existing cyberworld and everything needs to follow from that. I love this tablet but it has to go back. No help from manufacturer but expected none. Thank goodness for Amazon. Seriously bummed; there are some very nice things in the implementation of this tablet.	
96	4	4	3	0	0	1	0	1	4	4	3	0	frustration. i lost the chargeing cable. called their support to buy replacement to no avail. not a very responsive seller the tablet is of no use to me. prehaps you can offer a suggestion. i have bought several items from your web site that look similar. it was unsuccessful. the tablet was good but without replacement parts i would not recommend it.	
97	0	2	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	2	0	Good and Bad. I researched this tablet and suggested "we" buy this tablet for my niece's children for Christmas. We all pitched in and made it a nice Santa gift.  She bought two and liked them for a time.  In January, I purchased one myself and like it very much.  The problem is that this item freezes quite regularly and I don't know why, which means constant resetting.  My nephew's tablet had to be returned to LePan for service last month, after 3 months of use. A month later, it is still not back from the manufacturer.  Calling this company is very hard to get through to -- actually almost impossible.  The times that we did get through we were told they were totally backed up.  I'm not sure I like the sounds of that.  We now have a total of 3 of these units in our family and we did purchase the Square Trade warranty, but they only kick in after the LePan warranty expires.  For the money, I still like my unit, but am unhappy with the repair service my nephew received, and since I am the one who  did the research and suggested this, I feel badly about it.  He is a 12-year-old boy who really missed his tablet for a month.  My review would have been higher had I not had this experience with inability to contact the company after needing service shortly after purchase. I think most of us know that customer service can make or break a company no matter how good a product is.  More accessability to this company would have helped my rating immensely. Thanks.September 3,  2012I really hate to give bad reviews to any company trying to make competitive products in this market.  However,  this is probably one of the worst purchases i have made.  As noted,  we have 3 in the family and they have all been sent back once and need to go back again at the cost of $15 in postage everytime. If there were a class action suit against these tablets I would join it.  I can not even turn the tablet on unless I stick a pin in the reset hole so now iI keep a safety pin with my case! I find this as good as throwing $230 into the garbage disposal.	
98	0	3	3	0	4	3	0	4	3	4	4	4	Good as a first tablet PC. It's quite  a nice device and it became even better after I managed to make it work with bluetooth keyboard :)	
99	2	4	0	4	3	0	4	4	4	4	0	4	This is a great tablet, FOR THE 9 DAYS IT WORKED! I've only had this tablet for 5 days now, but boy is it nice! I was considering the iPad, but the price was out of reach for me. I happened to stumble accross this one here on Amazon. I read the reviews, watched many videos on YouTube and decided to take the plunge and order it. I thought why not give it a try? Amazon has great return policies. I considered the fact that it was a tablet, and a brand name I had never heard of, so I bought the extended warranty for it as well. I am a Tech, so I figured I could fix it if it broke, but the $60 price of the warranty was a no brainer.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of it so far. It's fast, the screen is great, and it's internal memory is expandible up to 32gb. The build quality is solid and I like the aluminum back. The only thing I found was a little flimsy was the power cord end where it plugs in to the Le Pan. It felt like the plastic end was a little thin and hollow feeling. It picks up my wi-fi signal very well. There is no lag when watching You Tube or Netflix.The only real downfall I see as of right now is the lack of accessories. Maybe that will change as this gains market share, but don't expect to go to your local retailer and pick up a case or extra charger and cable. I did buy a case for it here on Amazon that was custom made for the Le Pan 1 and 2 and it fits great!It's hard to find a used iPad at this price, and this tablet is every bit as good as an iPad 2 at more than half the cost. Go ahead and order it. You can return it if you don't like it, but I bet you end up being very happy with it.UPDATED: I had it for 9 days and loved it, but it wouldn't turn on today. Had it plugged in to the charger all night. No Le Pan logo, nothing...It was a really nice tablet for the 9 days it worked. I thought I would get something comparable to Apple, and it was,but It should last for more than 9 days.I'm going to buy an iPad.	
100	0	4	4	3	4	4	2	0	1	4	4	4	Awsome tablet!!! Can't some of the bad reviews. People need to do a little research. Would be nice this ran better right out of the box but.Try upgrading the firmware 9749.Install alittle widget called wifiwidget "fixes wifi issue not sure why"If your ambitious enough this tablet is now able to be rooted and there is a version cm7 gingerbread in its final stages of development .This is my second tablet but for a geek a gadget nerd this is great tablet dont believe there bs.	
101	4	2	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	love it! I am enjoying my le pan tc970. This is my first tablet and is very easy to use. The processor is snappy. The quality of the screen is very good. I am writing this to you using the speech recognition on my tablet. The battery life is excellent. I have not put it down since I got it. I highly recommend you purchasing this product.	
102	3	3	4	3	0	4	4	2	2	3	4	4	Great Tablet for the price. I had originally ordered the first version of this product then discovered it couldn't be upgraded to the most recent Android version so I cancelled and ordered the Le Pan II.  I have a desktop PC (used mostly for work) and a laptop that is heavy to lug around so wanted something more portable.  I have to say I love this table.  It has great features and is lightning fast and easy to use.  I brought it on a recent business trip and it allowed me to stay connected to home and the office.  I have a Kindle and the pre-loaded Kindle app on this table immediately synced to my Kindle allowing me to easily read my books on either device.  For the money it is a fantastic deal	
103	3	4	0	0	3	3	1	4	4	0	3	3	Nice tablet for the price. I was looking for a basic tablet to use to check email and surf the internet while on layovers, and the LePan II hits the mark.  It does everything I want it to do at a lesser price than the fancy tablets.  True, it may lack a few of the bells and whistles of those tablets, but why pay for features you don't need?  Sound quality is not great and buttons are tiny, but once you get used to it it works just fine.  I would make the same choice again, and am quite pleases with the purchase.	
104	4	3	0	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	3	3	3 weeks and still going strong ...... I am a techie and I am impressed.  Price is right, great screen size and resolution, nice design, performance is good. I am able to watch Netfix and You Tube - no problem.  Downloaded a ton of games for the kids and surf the net with no issues.Only once, after an overnight charge it would not power on. Wrote to Le Pan and got a reply within an hour with 4 options to try. I already did two of them and moved onto using the reset on the back.  Followed their directions and it came back with out lossing anything.  Am planning for the Droid ICS upgrade.Only rated this as 4 of 5 stars because I only had it for 3.5 weeks.I would recommend this unit.	
105	3	4	4	3	0	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	Best Tablet I have ever used + Best Price. I have used numerous Tablets over the years and this was by far the best deal I have ever seen for a tablet. I expected a lot of problems because of the price, but I have not had any real problems. The Wifi problems were fixed with the update, and beside a couple of times I had to restart it, it has been awesome. The tablet is extremely fast for a tablet thanks to the top of the line specs. The ability to use an SD card is very much under rated. You can add 32gb to the tablet without having to pay hundreds more. Here are a few things I have noticed about the Le Pan II Tablet:PROS:1.) Amazingly Fast. Almost Instant responses on everything I do. The Processor is one of the fastest you will find for any price.2.) SD Card Slot= Alows you to expand the memory by 32gb without having to pay hundreds more like on iPads. You also can interchange cards with movies and TV shows without worrying about filling up your hard drive.3.) PRICE= The best price I have seen for a tablets with this size screen and processor.4.) Screen = Same size as iPad. cant find a tablet this new with same screen size for the price. You can watch movies at angle. I cant tell any difference between watching a movie starring right at the center of the screen vs watching it with my eyes looking right at the side. On my laptop I am constantly trying to adjust the screen position to get a clearer image. Images are extremely bright and clear. HD looking resolution for movies. Love the Color.5.) Dont have to mess with iTunes6.) BATTERY LIFE= I was amazed with the battery life i got with this tablet. I watched more than 7 hours of netflix without having to dim my screen or recharge. Recharging seems to take a long time though.CONS:1.) App Store= tons of apps but just not the number of apps that you can find on ipad but more than you can find on a kindle fire. It still has all the major aps you can find on apple store like netflix, pandora, kindle app, AutoCAD, Facebook, Twitter, and many many more. TONS of games for kids though.2.) Speakers = Speakers dont seem to be that loud even with the sound on max. I normally use ear phones anyways so that has never been a problem with me.OVERALLYou cant beat the price for the quality you are getting. The tablet upgrates to Android Ice Cream Sandwich. It is hundreds and hundreds of dollars cheaper than ipad and matches it on ever spec and more. It is just a little over the price of kindle fire but with a much larger screen. It is cheap in price but definitely not cheap in quality. I cant believe I dont see more of these out there.	
106	2	0	3	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	0	0	Le Pan II Not too Happy. First-i am a user and owner of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 (which i dropped and borke-without isnurance to fix) and exhaustively researched replacement options for the Tablet. I really didn't see any reason to pay such a premium with so many options in the market right. I really researched all the tabs on the market and really was sold on the Le-Pan II. I loved the Micro Sd option it offered in particular.I got the package promptly after placing the order and quickly opened it up. Everything was there. I charged fully overnight and then powered up the next morning. It went through the boot process and opened to the main unlock screen. to m y horror the unit would not react to any finger touches anywhere on the entire screen. I tried to power off but couldn't use my finger to select the turn off prompt on the screen. I used the reset button with a paperclip as suggested six times. Every time i reset i got as far as the unlock screen.While its only been day one and i am returning the unit for a replacement i am very dissapointed that the first one didn't work right out of the box. I have heard so many good things about Le-Pan. Its a solid well built unit but if it doesn't get beyond the first screen its just another piece of clutter on my desk.They get one more try-the next unit needs to work or they lost me a customer for good and i wait till October for the next batch of tabs to come out and buy a new brand altogether	
107	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	3	4	Very Fast and easy to use. I bought Le Pan II after reading reviews of how good it was.  So far it has been everything I expected.  Fsst, easy to use and just as good as the Ipad.  My only issue is for some reason after charging I had to reset in order for it to start.  It has only happened twice.  Once i do that it is fine, it's just annoying.	
108	2	2	0	3	0	3	1	4	4	3	0	0	A piece of Junk with sorry customer service! This tablet is the worst piece of junk I have ever seen. It worked good for the first month or two then the nightmare begin. I had to swap this tablet 4 times and went through heck to get someone on the phone each time. The company has only one line with no voicemail good luck talking to them. I had to call several times just to get to speak to someone.  Their turn around time for exchanges is a painstaking 4 or 5 weeks and would have been longer had I not have called and threaten the with the better business bureau.  When the 4 one crashed I finally rooted the tablet and flashed it with another rom hoping the problems were from bugs in their Android build. Well it worked for awhile and crashed again and the screen started giving strange flashing problems. After several hours upon hours of frustration I finally said I had had enough. I shut the piece of junk down and threw it in a parts drawer because that is all it is worth. Do yourself a huge favor and stay away for this tablet, Far away. I am an IT support tech and have fixed some hard to fix computers and I did not have the patience to put up with this piece of junk.	
109	3	4	0	0	4	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	terrible product,company and overall experience. I received the Le Pan 2 as a gift and was very excited given the great reviews. You can imagine my disappointment when the tablet could not even connect to the internet. What can you do with a tablet without internet connection? not much.  It was all downhill from there.The customer support is a joke - its literally one guy who doesn't speak English well answering emails (they don't have phone support). They suggested i change some settings on my router - nothing worked although i did waste hours trying everything and even called my router tech support. Given the $300 price tag i bought a new router for $50 and luckily it was able to maintain a connection. but what if i want to visit a coffee shop, will the LePan be able to connect to that router? who knows...Basically this product is a piece of crap - another example - i couldn't download ebooks directly on my Google books app. It would open Google Play but there would be no option for searching e-books. i emailed Google Play tech support about this and they responded telling me the 'Le Pan' was not a supported device for Android (they've never even heard of it!) - i couldn't believe it.if you think you're saving money with this device - you're not. there's a reason everyone buys the iPad. you get what you pay for. Although in this case you get ripped off. its not worth the $300 price tag - i would say maybe $100.	
110	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	great tablet great price. I bought this tablet for my husband for valentines day this year and over all he's been satisfied with it.	
111	0	0	4	0	4	0	4	4	4	4	0	4	It was ok. Well i ordered the Le Pan as a present, but when it came it would not turn on. I sent it back and it took a long time for them to replace it and have it shipped back to me. Anyway, the second one i got, I was surprised it worked! But it was a really good tablet, then 3 months later it completely quit on me! I could not replace it so i am not happy with it.	
112	2	0	0	0	0	1	0	4	4	4	2	0	Good/bad. Good tablet & horrible customer service through the lepan company, their customer service was so horrible that i returned it before 30 days and got my money back so i didn't have to deal with them in the future.  I called the 1800 number from the lepantab website it took me a few days after calling many times to get a hold of them, they were unable to answer simple questions about my tablet AND on top of that they put me on hold about 5 times, were laughing and joking around in the background, and hung up on me and ignored my calls after the hang up, very disapointed.	
113	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	4	Great product. I was a little hesitant about the Lepan I read about freeze ups but that is a no issue. It works better than I could have expected. Great product at a great price.	
114	1	0	0	3	1	4	1	1	4	3	0	0	Disappointed!!! Even after expanding the memory to a 16gb, with a recommended memory card for tablets, it constantly froze! Every 10 minutes I had to reset it. So disappointed!	
115	3	2	2	4	0	4	3	0	4	3	3	4	inexpensive quality product. Purchased 1 for personal review. Looking for a  tablet that was easy for a group to use together in order to reduce the amount of papers distributed at a meeting.Purchased 10 more units. Costs were 140 dollars per unit and were delivered in less than a week.Purchase through Walmart because of their easy return policy.The power hookup is a little hinky.  Resembles an iPod's---  long thin plug in. But is not interchangeable.	
116	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	4	4	3	0	0	terrible. This product is terrible i havnt had it a month and it doesnt come  on ,Power button is broken and wont allow the system to cut on without resetting. now wont cut on at all. No damn warranty. Waste of my hard earn money......	
117	4	3	2	0	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	Got More Then Expected. I was not sure I would really like this product but from reading other reviews on here I thought I would give it a try - I sure am glad I did!This unit at times acts more like a PC then just an ordinary tablet PC. It easily reads Kindle books along with PDF files, surfs the Internet (built-in WiFi and Bluetooth), reads both Web-based and pop/smtp/IMAP email accounts, plays a wide assortment of games and is well integrated with most all Google, Firefox, Opera and IE browser features. Has speech recognition, built in mic & camera along with many other common tablet PC features.A friend of mine was visiting and played with my Le Pan II for a couple hours and told me his iPad does less then this unit does and he was going to trade it in and get a Le Pan II.Now the only thing left to try is see how it's longevity lasts.... I highly recommend this device!	
118	4	4	3	4	4	2	4	2	0	4	3	4	great tablet. This tablet is fast and has a lot of features. The volume is loud and clear. It's affordable. The only con is that the battery time is short but it does charge fast.	
119	3	0	4	3	4	1	3	2	1	4	4	4	nice tablet. I own several. lepan tablets. This tablet doesn't play netflix movirs. still a fun fast tablet. my granddaughters love using this. tablet. would recomend it highly .	
120	0	1	2	0	3	1	3	1	0	4	0	0	Not worth the money. This product is not worth spending your money on.  I ordered one last year. It started messing up in about 6 mos., but kept it and gave it the benefit of the doubt. It continuously got worse, and just shut down completely. Got in touch with LePan and they did replace it, but it was right at the year mark. The new one I received started messing up immediately. Screen would freeze and I would have to reset it. It got to the point that I would have to restart it 6-8 times within an hour. It then started to show horizontal colored lines, but nothing else. It would not turn on without resetting it. After this, it would not turn on without it being plugged in and resetting it. Final straw was 2 nites ago when it did not respond to anything. LePan has told me that my warranty with them did not extend just because they sent me a new tablet and they would charge $100.00+ to ship & fix it. This does not say much for their company or their product. I will not order anything else that has their name on it.	
121	3	3	0	0	1	0	4	4	1	4	1	1	Expected longer life. Expected this tablet to last longer than it has. Have owned this for less than a year and a half and it will not re-boot. It began to be quirky when I would need to re-set it. Sometimes it would not re-set without plugging into charger after doing the re-set button. This had nothing to do with it's level of charge, which was always kept ok.Customer service suggested different procedures. Non worked and when they instructed me to upgrade the firmware. I realized this was going nowhere as it has to boot up to do that.So with a cost of $100 + to do any repairs Le Pan has become useless to me.	
122	4	2	4	4	4	3	1	1	3	4	1	4	Good hardware for the money. Not much else. This is a good tablet for what you pay. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have probably mentioned, the support is nil. You're better off going with a more main-stream name brand.  Inability to keep the hard keys lit for low light reading is just one of the several annoying things that will probably never get fixed due to this product's zero support from the manufacturer.	
123	0	3	3	4	0	4	3	4	4	4	2	0	Wifi Stopped after 6 months. The data cable stopped working after about two months.The wifi stopped working after about six months.I would re-flash its firmware to get the wifi to work, but I can't because the data cable doesn't work.If not for these two problems, this would be my favorite tablet, by FAR.	
124	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	2	4	2	4	Great tablet until you update to ICS. I bought this tablet, took it home and updated it to 4.0.3 the next day I noticed whenever you open the side bar half the screen cuts off and flashes. I returned it, bought one somewhere else after taking home and an hour after updating got the same glitch. I decided to play around with the display tablet after returning mine and their display tabby had the same glitch. I would have loved the tablet if I wouldn't have that glitch. =/	
125	4	0	2	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	0	0	very very disappointed. I've had this brand NEW tablet for only 3 weeks and now it won't turn on anymore, its known for the SOD (Sleep Of Death) and thats what happened to mines. I suggest no one to buying this tablet $300+ tax wasted , im sticking with laptops for now on	
126	3	3	4	4	0	4	2	4	2	1	4	4	Awesome tablet for $300. I gave this a five star rating because its exactly that, five stars! This tablet is very good and i love it. I originally got this product as a Christmas gift last year. Played around on it and i didn't like the preloaded apps so i rooted it and then it really went downhill. The apps crashed and a lot weren't working, it was very annoying so i decided just to buy another one. The size of this tablet is perfect and the weight is very lite. The 2.0 megapixel web camera is better then my laptop and my ipod and it doesn't bother me that there is no back camera. I enjoy the USB port so that i can transfer pictures, videos, and documents from my laptop to my tablet. The micro SD card that can hold up to 32GB which helps save space on my tablet. It takes 4 hours for a full charge which is pretty good. The screen is pretty bright with the brightness all the way up. The only disappointing thing is the speakers, not the greatest but it does the job it needs to plus if i plug in my earphones i could probably go deaf because it so loud so overall im very happy with this and probably will be for a long time	
127	1	3	4	0	4	4	4	1	2	2	1	4	It ok..... Alright i will start off saying that i have used a lot of electronic tablets smart phones ect, BUT this did not even come in a real acer box! it was shrink wrapped to a piece of cardboard, i use it mostly for playing NES SNES N64 and GBA games, but it work fine.	
128	4	4	4	4	1	4	0	4	4	2	3	3	Heavy but Nice. Pro: I got mine used so was super cheap. Quick speed, Google Play, adjustable sensitivity, responsive, micro usb and USB. Screen is the perfect size for reading online books/comics/manga. bluetooth. netflix works great. good screen resolution, seems durable.Con: No HDMI, not obvious way to lock screen in one position (downloaded an app), Apps pretty limited compared to phone, lots of pre-installed software. speakers are pretty quiet, brightness is limited. gets pretty warm (not in a case).overall 8.2/10	
129	4	4	4	3	4	2	4	3	3	4	3	4	GREAT PRICE GREAT PERFOMANCE. IT IS EASY TO DRIVE, MY SON 3 YEARS DRIVES ALL THIS TABLET, IT HAVE NOT CAMERA (4 STARS), HAVE 16GB INTERNAL, AND I UPDATE TO 16GB MORE AND WORKS VERY VERY WELL, INTERNET IS VERY FAST, GAMES 3D ARE VERY FAST, SCREEN IS VERY VERY CLEAR, BATTERY IS LONG LIFE, FAST CHARGING. I LOVE THIS TABLETI RECOMMNED YOU BUY THIS TABLET	
130	1	1	0	4	0	4	4	4	0	4	1	0	Have to pay for Tech support. After having this tablet for 2 years and one month.. It started freeezing up on me about 2 months ago. I would restart it. Sometimes it would go the first time and sometimes it would take 3 or 4 times to get it to start up.. It has always been slow to start up. Recently, it has froze on the start up of ACER.. then would never move past it. I have had to reboot it by pushing the volume up and power on at the same time. It would work for a while then freeze up. I was told it was a software issue.. think it was Instagram.. so I tried to factory reset it. It is now stuck on the start up screen of ACER and will not move from it. I have tried to get help from the company but they said since my warranty was up ..they said Feb 10, 2012.. which I find ironic that I did not even buy it until Feb 12, 2012 and did not recieve it in the mail until Feb 18, 2012 that I would have to PAY for tech support. I told them that it was ridiculous!! $79.99 for a one time fix! I said no thanks. So now I am left with a dud tablet that does nothing. I would not buy an ACER again!!	
131	4	4	4	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Well built and reliable tablet at a good price point ! I have had this tablet since January 12th. I saw some in the cage when I was about to purchase a Sony S tablet and told the girl that I wanted it. I was afraid they may not sell it to me since it was not supposed to be released until the 15th but they did. I have thoroughly researched and tested all of the available tablets at Best Buy which include the I-Pad 2, Galaxy Tab, Motorola Xoom, Ausus Transformer, Transformer Prime, Sony S, Toshiba Thrive and the Motorola Xoom Family edition. I must say that I wish the Prime did not have all of the issues that it has especially the wi-fi signal dropping while bluetooth is connected. I tested two different floor models of the Prime and was able to replicate intermittent signal drops of the wi-fi signal. Proof of this was not only evident in the signal icon but also while watching you tube videos. At one of the stores I even switched from a wi-fi router to an AT&T; mobile hotspot. Even though I was pulling over 20 mb download the videos would constantly buffer. The Galaxy Tab seemed very tempting but I did notice some lag with the 10.1 and 8.9 as well compared to the Acer A200 especially when trying to type on them but also in some transitions. I blame the Samsung overlay of touchwiz for this. I also noticed that the whites did not look as pure when compared to the A200. These things along with the lack of ports and the known issues of the oil slick screen defect problems many are having deterred me from the 10.1 tab. Moving on, the Sony S was also a tempting tablet for me but I have read about some of them having wi-fi issues and also about them shutting off no matter what you set the screen off setting to. Ironically, both of the Sony units I tested had the screen shut down issue which was very annoying. The Toshiba Thrive was worth a good look but It to me is not to aesthetically appealing and one of the units did a random reboot while I was testing it so I dismissed it after careful consideration.The Thrive and the reboot issue is a known issue that I am not sure if Toshiba has a solution for.  Both of the Motorola units were alright but I never really considered either one to much because I know that they have inferior screens and I am not to interested in a tablet with kids apps built in as the family edition has. I wanted to like the original Transformer also but in a side by side screen comparison The Acer A-200's screen just looked a lot better as the Transformers screen would not get as bright and had a blue tint to it's whites. Then there is the good old I-Pad 2 which I did take the time to test and it is a nice piece of hardware with a good screen. The problem is it does not have an operating system that suits a tablet well in my opinion. It is boring with no widgets and customization like Honeycomb and a locked down Apple ecosystem. NO Thanks ! Well that leaves the  Acer A-200 which I have had since mid January. In my opinion it is the best looking Tablet out right now. I can also tell you that it is very well built and well optimized on the software side. I had the Acer A-500 before I returned and got this one and both of the Acer's seemed a bit snappier than the others. I returned the A-500 because the screen looked to washed out when I was in some browsing situations. Some people have been complaining about the sound on the A-200 on the Best Buy review section but all you have to do if you are not happy with it is download a free app from the Android market called Equalizer by Smart android apps and  you can make it sound however you want. It gets plenty loud after adjusting the EQ and if you buy the Key you can save presets for different situations like you tube or music. I have been very pleased with my A-200 and have not had any issues with it accept that I noticed the mic seemed a bit low when trying to do speech to text but not while using the voice recorder. I have read about some people saying that it is low on skype also but I do not use it for that so I do not know exactly how it performs with that but I would say maybe try a different app like Fring or something. If you can live without a rear camera and HDMI out then I would highly recommend the Acer A-200 because for $300.00 I think it is the best deal out there right now. It does have a full size usb port that I can confirm works with a PS3 controller and a logitech pc game controller as well as an old ps2 logitech keyboard I had lying around. I also have been using a microsoft mouse that I have as a spare and it works flawlessly. Other than that it has a headphone jack, Micro sd card slot and a proprietary power jack and this thing charges in an hour and a half tops. I would say just buy it if you do not think you want a quad core or feel like waiting for one that does not have the issues of the prime. For $300.00 you can not go wrong with this outstanding piece of electronic technology. It really is an awesome looking tablet and it feels great holding it with the rubberized backing and smooth curves ! Oh yea it has the best Wi-Fi reception out of the three Android phones and the two other 7" Android tablets that I have. None of them can get reception out in my driveway by the carport but the A-200 does. It also locked on to 7 satellites with stand alone GPS outside where my A-500 could only get three ! My other devices are the HTC EVo 4g LTE, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung Epic 4g (wifes), Nook Color and the Huawei S7 tablet. Thanks for reading and I hope you all found this review informative!Update! It is almost 6 months Later and I have updated my review! Changed the price from $350.00 to $300.00 and added my two new phones the Evo 4g LTE and the Galaxy S3 and Gave my Epic 4g to my wife. A whole slew of new tablets have come out and yes some of them are definately better than the A200. Galaxy Note $500.00, Galaxy Tab2 $400.00, Ausus Transformer Prime TF700T $500.00,Ausus TF300T $350.00 Acer A510 $420.00, Acer A700 $430.00  the Toshiba Exite 10.1 $370-$400, Toshiba Excite 10.1 LE $400.00 to $435.00and the New Sony Experia 10.1 $399.00  to name a few. All of these with the exception of the Galaxy Tab 2 and the Toshiba Excite are Quad Core and all of the Quad cores with the exception of the Galaxy Note 10.1 have the Tegra 3. I Have not tested all of these but I can tell you that the Galaxy Note 10.1 with the Samsung Exynos is the best Processor and the Transformer prime TF700T and the Acer A700 have the best screens.It is also worth noting that the Galaxy Tab 2 and the Toshiba Excite LE have the Ti Omap 4430 dual core 1.2 ghz processor and that processor is not necessarily better than the Tegra 2. I have actually read a review about the original Galaxy Tab with the Tegra 2 and the new one with the Ti Omap 4430 and they said that the Tegra 2 actually outperformed the Omap in some areas. I have also read consumer reviews about people complaining about Tablets with the Omap Lagging. Amazon also has a Toshiba Excite listed with a pxa270 processor saying that it is a TI Omap clocked at 1.2ghz. The pxa270 is a marvel processor clocked at 520mhz. Marvel bought it from Intel years ago and the Toshiba website does not have anything like that so it is either a typo or worse a knock off I would suspect. I really do not think Toshiba would put a Marvel processor in one of there Tablets as they are found in the cheap chinese Android Tablets. I have now tried out the Galaxy Tab 2, Galaxy Note 10.1 the Toshiba exite Le 10.1 and the Ausus Tf300T. I really liked the Galaxy Tab 2 and it is getting pretty good reviews about on par with the Acer A200 which by the way still rates really high with consumers on Best Buy and Amazon. The Acer A200 is on par with the Galaxy Tab 2, Ausus TF300T and better than the Toshiba Excite any model if you look at the review ratings. In my testing with HD videos the Tegra 2 in the A200 handled them better I noticed some hesitation with the Omap 4430 in movement especially on the Toshiba excite. Playback was smoother on the Acer A200 with the same You Tube HD video. The Excite and the Galaxy Tab 2 screens may have a higher PPI which could be one reason.  They are both good chips with the Omap having dual channel memory with a lower clock speed on the ram and also a lower clock speed on the GPU which could also contribute to slightly lower performance than the Tegra in certain areas and video being one of them . The Omap will slighlty out perform the Tegras CPU but is known to be harder on your battery. I liked the Tf300T and the Tegra 3 worked great with the video playback It just felt very flimsy and bent really easily. So with all of these new tablets on the market and new ones coming out all of the time. One thing has not changed and that is that the Acer A200 is still one of if not the best values in a 10 inch tablet.  Now If you have $500 dollars to spend the Galaxy Note 10.1 is an outstanding tablet. The Ausus TF700T is also getting good reviews but is also $500.00. I had a person comment on the Lenevo Thinkpad which is now $320 at Best Buy for the Tegra 2 version but I have read about it having a lot of shortfalls in reviews. Lenevo has a lot of new models out now that do not have to many consumer reviews. Lenevo is not as mainstream when it comes to tablets as other Brands. If you want a good 10 inch tablet that won't break the bank the A200 is still a great buy and I seriously doubt you would be dissapointed with it. It responds and transitions very quickly through screens and into the app drawer and such. It is a very high quality device and a great deal at $300.00 !	
132	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	Acer A200. Purchased my A200 about a week ago.  It was tough to find locally and it appears as though Android tablets in general are hard to find...quantities are very low right now.  I ended up checking with about 10 different local electronics chains and office supply type stores until I finally found someone that had just received 2 in.While not the cheapest nor the best peforming tablet on the market, I really think this is a winner in the value category.  While I am typically a latest and greatest type person when it comes to electronics/computers, I really just didn't see the need to drop another $150+ on a high end tablet.  I'll use mine mostly for Internet access, some gaming, email, Netflix, etc.  With the exception of the more advanced games, a dual core versus a new quad core just isn't going to make much of a difference if at all and even right now on the gaming side, I don't think there is a whole lot that will take advantage of quad core chips. If I do want to do some photo and/or video editing, I will break out my much more powerful laptop. I really think buyers need to evaluate their true needs when it comes to buying these.One of the first things I did once I got connected via wifi, was to do the upgrade to Ice Cream Sandwich and I definitely wasn't disappointed.  It is a beautiful OS that seems to run quite well on the A200. Transitions run well and smooth, and only until I enabled live wallpaper did I see any lag to speak of when moving from one home screen to another.  Even then it wasn't an issue for me and frankly a quad core may not make a difference.While this tablet isn't the thinnest nor the lightest, it is still in the same ballpark and frankly I really appreciate a little extra heft and thickness since I have larger hands.  The textured back feels nice in my hands and not as slippery as an iPad and overall it just feels very solid and robust to me.  I think it will hold up quite well...I'm very impressed for a $350 device.To summarize, here are the pros and cons as I see it:Pros:Value, value, value - can't beat it for $350 for a 10", with ICS and level of qualityIce Cream Sandwich...yummy yummy ice cream :)Solid designGreat screen resolution - better than iPad 1 and 2.  Screen is sharp and very bright even at lower brightness settings.  Default is around 40% and I see no need to go higher.Colors are vibrant and seem to be accurate and text is clear...looks better than my 17" Dell laptop and wife's Lenovo screensFull sized USB - used with USB sticks and it worked great for transferring files and photos.  I haven't tried any other accessories yet, but wondering if a USB game pad would work???  Doubt it but would be great if it did.Micro SD card slot - I plugged in a 16 gig from an old blackberry and it was able to read the photos and music I had on it.  Astro file manager is included with ICS and works well for moving files around.Battery life is great...the first night I had it, I had it off of the charger for 5 hours straight (4:58 to be exact) playing games, surfing, and installing apps and it still reported 52% battery life left...very impressive!Cons:Current lack of accessoriesLack of rear camera - really a non issue for me as I don't anticipate using the camera anyhow.  My Android phone has an 8 mega-pixel camera already and I have a mid-range Canon DSLR that I take if I anticipate shooting photos.Sometimes when bringing up my browser, the A200 will tell me it doesn't have an Internet connection.  I refresh and all is good.  Not sure if this is an ICS issue or an issue with hardware but likely ICS.Sound levels are little on the low side although I don't have any other tablets that I can compare to.  It's certainly acceptable.  I did download an equalizer program but I started hearing a weird crackling sound through the speakers so I uninstalled and all is well again.  I may try a different program but so far a non-issue.Stupid built-in Android browser defaults to mobile sites, not full.  This is an Android built-in browser issue though (seriously why don't they fix this for Tablets).  The normal work arounds didn't do anything...debug mode and browser check box for full sites didn't work.  My workaround was to install Boat browser which seems to work well for displaying full sites.Big con, is that my wife initially thought I wasn't smart buying yet another gadget, but now that she has tried it, I can't get it away from her.  Same thing with 4 year old son...he thinks it's his now (istorybook is awesome app for kids BTW).In summary, evaluate your needs for a tablet.  If this is a back up device and you already have a PC/laptop/Mac for more processor intensive apps and you want/need a device for surfing, portability, easy of use, game playing and don't need a rear camera or 3/4G connectivity this is a wonderful device for a wonderful price.  I love it!	
133	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	What I paid for... Got my tablet last night...I have been waiting a couple of weeks and have read way to many reviews on it... I did spend about 5 hours straight working on it...I know I need to get a life! It's nice and compact...I agree, the construction seems solid. I quicly loaded a 32 Gb card on to it, the door that covers the card Slot is cumbersome, and I'm certian that if I fumble with it much it will snap off.I was quick to load my apps...the downloads were fast...and my bluetooth headphones linked in a instant, people have complained about the speakers...guess i can't really comment as used my head phones with it all night, and the fast forward , pause feaure worked fine.I use "Audiogalaxy" Cloud service and it synced perfect.I then Loaded several movies in the AVI format...it promtmpted me that the stock player would not support this format, I then downloaded MX Video player and a 2nd MX Video player codec, and the movies played really well and both video and audio, I did see some intitail lag in the sync of these...but quickly they caught up.it's a fingerprint magnet, to be expected, using a stylus pen was helpful.Lastly i loaded a bunch of comics onto a usb Drive, the full USB port is awesome! it took some time for the drive to fire up... a minute...but the comics look awesome using the CRB reader. the pictures I loaded looked great and the zoom feature is very nice.It wasnt until this was loaded that i then Updated to ICS, the download was super fast and it did change the overall look of the Tab...not sure I like it as much, and maybe the late hour but it seemed the Wi-Fi connection was weaker and the flash player didnt work...it redirected the videos on the link to the stock player...will investigate...overall nice player...but was left feeling underwhelmed. My wife say...cause im spoiled...maybe shes right...but i digress...In summary for the price I would recommend it...for me its really just another toy!4/1/12 April Fools it is!! Charged it last night unalbe to power it up today!! Acer tech support HORRIBLE!!, prior to this it was smooth sailing...Amazon on the other hand Top notch!!! sending my brick back tomorrow for a full refund! Stay away for this product!!!	
134	4	2	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	Good but some small issues. As far as the OS goes it runs on Android and you either like Android or you don't. This isn't going to sway you away from iOS. The hardware is very good but sometimes the touchscreen can be unresponsive for a few seconds but then it works perfectly. This doesn't happen often but is annoying when it does.	
135	0	0	4	2	0	4	4	2	0	1	0	0	Am I the only one that got a LEMON? Where do I begin.....After opening the box and reading the instructions, I plug the tablet into the charger and charge it. Once it was fully charged, I played around on it to get used to it. About an hour passed and I had to go to work the next day, I turned it off. When I got home from work, the next day, I tried to power on the tablet and it wouldn't power on. Did I not shut it down properly? Was the battery completely drained? These were the questions I was asking myself as I spend about a half hour trying to turn it on. I plugged it up to the charger and let it charge for a few hours...nothing, no light on the power button, pressing and holding the power button did absolutely nothing, and I tried different ways of pressing the power button (thinking I was doing it wrong) and still nothing.I call the eight hundred number for Acer customer service and behold...the dreaded digital answering system which will not allow you to press zero to talk to a representative. After thirty minutes or so fooling with the digital answering service, I finally get to talk to a human being....from India...who is reading from a script and trying their best to avoid answering my questions. After saying "I'm sorry, I don't comprehend what you are saying" about a hundred times, I was told to print out a shipping return label and send it to Acer. I was also told that it would take ten business days to repair the tablet and no they would not replace it, I tried. So it was shipped out by FedEx Ground (2-3 days), take them ten days to repair it, and then ship it back to me (maybe by FedEx Ground 2-3 days?). By my calculations, I should receive it back after three weeks...this has to be the worst experience I have ever had with an online purchase and with an Acer product.	
136	4	4	4	4	3	4	0	2	4	1	4	4	Solid Purchase!! This product is amazing and at a great price. I was in the market for a new e-reader but after some research and playing around, this was a must buy. It functions extremely well as an e-reader, a multi-media device, and an all around beast. With the right apps from the Android market place you can use your phone as a free Hot-Spot ;).Also, there is conversion software out there, that will allow you to turn your video files into MP4's so you can enjoy your shows anywhere you go!If you are in the market for an amazing tablet at a solid price, this is the tablet for you! There isn't a need to drop a ton of money down on a iPad.	
137	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	Amazing Iconia Tab A200. Let me first state that the Iconia Tab A200 (16gig) that I received from Amazon has a manufacture date of March 2012. Some of the issues that I was concerned about, after reading many reviews, may have been addressed by Acer with this manufacturing date. That is only a guess on my part because I have not seen earlier models.Two issues in particular that concerned me were the WiFi reception and the screen glare. These are no longer concerns. The wireless reception on this tablet is fantastic. In a side-by-side comparison with my i-Pad 2, screen glare is on par and there is virtually no difference. In fact I love this screen: extremely bright and sharp. Touch sensitivity and accuracy are right-on.I just love this tablet. The build quality is second to none, with a nice rubbery feel on the back side. It's a little heavier and chunkier than my iPad 2, but not by much and for me the difference is negligible. I have owned a few Android tablets, but this is the first with 1gb of system ram. That, coupled with the NVIDIA Tegra 2 mobile processor with Dual Core ARM Cortex A9, makes for a very snappy tablet that does not disappoint. I know those specs are a little outdated with the latest and greatest seemingly released every week, but the A200 sure is fast.The internet experience on the Iconia Tab is terrific. This factor is probably my number one motivation for this purchase. The supplied Google Chrome Browser is very fast and, because I use Google Chrome on my desktop computer, all of my bookmarks were immediately synced and transferred to the Iconia Tab. That's pretty cool.I could go on and on: battery life great; Android ICS amazing with seamless coordination of contacts and calendar from my Android phone; movies and music very impressive; recognized and connects to my desktop with little effort (I hate iTunes)... Needless to say I highly recommend the Iconia Tab A200. Love my iPad, but now it just sits there;)Bravo Acer!!	
138	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	1	1	3	4	4	Can't Beat The Price Point. I will be brief with this as most everyone else has already captured my praise for this item.I picked up a refurb A200 from 1SaleaDay for $160 and this thing is flat out perfect for me in regard to the combination of utilization for business and entertainment. It is fast, works well on ICS 4.0 (with an upgrade arriving soon from Acer for JB 4.1), and basically offers you everything you could want. With a battery life between 7.5 and 9.5 hours (on my usage), it gives me all the juice I need to get through a few days of sporadic use here and there.Quite simply, I highly recommend this unit to anyone out there looking for a rock solid 10" tab that can basically do it all for you.	
139	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	3	4	Good tablet. The tablet looks great is thin has a good size screen and a very good price point only problem so far was one screen freeze up, but I just had to power off and on and it was fine.... I got mine for 250, I thing 300 is a great price for though the only small problem would be the tiny amount of lag every so often but that's okay......  overall I would really recommend it to anybody looking for a bigger tablet	
140	4	3	4	4	4	0	3	4	1	3	4	4	just a great tablet. This product is one of the best other than having a iPad. Works beautiful, very happy with it. The first one I did send back, but they sent another and so far no problems what's so ever. Good company and good service.  I would recommend it to anyone, the price was right.	
141	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	4	AWESOME! This has got to be the best thing I have ever bought from amazon yet. They got me my product a  week sooner than expected and they tablet itself is amazing. I love this product and it's a great buy for the price. The seller did a great job in describing what it does and I am just over all satisfied with this product and the seller. :)	
142	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Acer A200 Review. I recently bought this device as a "store clearance" (new in box) at a remarkably low price to replace my Zepad (Zenithink C92).  I am impressed with the overall performance and highly recommend it.  It is quite responsive and fast acting.  The colors are crisp and very natural.  The speakers are much better than I expected with enough volume if one is using it in his hands, but I'll still use it with headphones because of the sound quality.  It has only a front facing camera, but I doubt I would use it even if it had a rear facing camera since I have a nice small 14 MP pocket size camera.  The GPS works great, but again I have a Tom Tom GPS that I have used about 3 times in 4 years.  I usually know how to get to where I'm going.  Google maps are also great and give good directions.  Since the initial set-up The battery is at 33% after 61 hours with about 7 hours of actual use and the remainder of the time is at "sleep".  The first night I did the set up and played with it a little and downloaded about 10 apps that I use frequently in less than 2 hours.  The overall feel of  the case is superb.  It has a nice quality feel.  I downloaded a couple of books and it makes a great eReader.  Price aside, this is one of the best tablets that I've seen displayed in stores.  If anyone is in the market and can get one for under $275, don't hesitate, just do it, as I did.  The suggested retail is normally $349.  The info card at the display said Android 3.2 (honecomb), but when I got it up and running I found it using Android 4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich).  Netflix works very good (the main reason I bought it, since the ZePads 4.0.3 have a flaw and can only get audio, don't know why Zenithnk and Netflix can't fix this, but that's another story) Five stars ++Update 01/25/13  I continue to be impressed with this device.  I didn't realize it, but I have the version with 16GB of memory.  And it came with McAfee Virus Scan Mobile at no cost to me and is now at work 100% of the time.  My WiFi connection is much better than with my previous tablet.  3 bars most of the time at a distance of appx 50 feet from the router and never quits.  The "Acer Ring" is unnessary, but COOL and intersting, but I am using it most of the time now.  Update 04/19/13. The Acer A200 and I have become very good friends and I use it every day.  I deal with weight problem by resting it on my lap and sometimes place a pillow behind it.  I've come to rely more on the ring and glad its' there.  The case finish is unique with a nice feel, BUT it tends to be more slippery than the conventional finishes.  I located a couple of apps to improve the low volume, but still use the headphones when Netflixing.  I also have a nook color, but rarely use it now.  Having access to Kindle is a big plus.  Very happy with my Acer A200.	
143	4	0	4	3	1	4	2	4	4	3	1	0	Concept good, implementation terrible -- Staples won't stand by it. I had the Iconia Tab A200. It was a 10.1 inch (diagonal) display, and ran a dual core CPU of some make (ARM, perhaps?). Until it met its end, it was a completely satisfactory tablet. The only complaint I had about it was that it's heat level grew while the battery was charging; but not so bad as to make it unusable.The most irritating complaint I *do* have is the sturdiness (NOT) this unit is made with. A mere fall from 16" was enough to shatter the screen glass (death to a touch-screen device): it fell lower-left-hand-corner first, and it actually struck the hardwood floor on that corner, as far as I could tell, there was no direct contact between the glass and the hardwood. But the craze pattern shows that the cracking started from the LLC (lower left hand corner), then grew like a tree in the direction of the URC. The "branches" of that craze tree (there were 14 of them, in total). I'm surprised that so little a force could do so much damage. I've tortured tested laptops by dropping them 7' onto cured cement, and the damage was nowhere near total as this one. I've also tortured other tablets (iPad all sorts, Galaxy all sorts, several Nooks, etc.) -- none of them exhibited this kind of damage at similar stresses. My **phone** (original Samsung Galaxy S) is more durable than this: I can run it over with a car and not damage anything non-superficial.I took it back to where I bought it: Staples. I am asking all to seriously reconsider buying anything major from Staples at all. I declined to purchase their rather expensive warranty when I bought the tablet, and because I didn't buy that warranty, Staples wouldn't even accept the item for warranty service, never mind that the Iconia was still under factory warranty. I have permanently fired Staples: they won't be receiving any more of my money -- Wal-Mart does a better job of customer service and satisfaction than Staples does.I now own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1", which I bought from Wal-Mart, along **with** the reasonably ($28) priced two year replacement warranty.I have had a most amicable relationship with Staples until today. As of today, I have fired them, and ask all who read this to reconsider spending money there. I left my Staples Reward card on the counter just to remind them of the revenue they'll be missing from here forward. You know, all they had to do was temporarily absorb the $270 or so I spent on the Iconia to begin with, and perhaps Staples would have stayed in the running for repeat dollars. NOT ANY MORE. Burn me once, shame on you; burn me twice, shame on me.	
144	4	4	4	4	3	1	3	4	1	4	4	4	bought 6 and they are all excellent. I am configuring 6 of these tablets and while doing so I have not found an issue or problem with any of them. The only drawback I can see in the unit is the weight and no back camera, both of which were not requirements of mine. I researched a long time for a "name brand" 10" tablet that would have available accessories, supported apps, and which had been on the  market long enough to get a large number of good and descriptive ratings. This Acer tablet was the leading make/model I found that met those requirements ...at the lowest price point of all of the "name brand" makes/models. A nice market sweet spot for Acer.	
145	2	4	3	1	3	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	Best to date. I've own it for one week but it's amazing. It's just an entertainment tool for me but i love it. Battery life is above the average so is the recharging time. Video resolution is better than my $2k HD 3D LCD 55" Samsung TV. I had an ipod touch before and videos that were stuning in the touch are no good in the ipad 3 but i guess i will have to change the resolution in the videos that i store and record from now on. Nevertheless, like always from Apple, a product five years ahead of time in thecnology years, which is 20 years in human years.	
146	2	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	Decent upgrade from the iPad2; some compromise. I love my iPad 2. The weight and size was about the max that I thought I could withstand in a handheld device.  For me, the iPad 3 is a set of compromises that I decided was worth it in the end.Weight/thickness: If you hold your iPad a lot when using it, then I think you will notice the extra heft of the third gen iPad.  It's not major, but it's noticeable. I find that I become a fatigued more quickly when reading in bed or holding the iPad on the plan while watching a movie, etc.Heat:  Yes, it runs a lot warmer than my iPad 2.  You will notice it.  The heat adds to the overall fatigue, largely because the greatest heat occurs exactly where you hold the iPad in portrait mode (lower left corner). Sure would have been nice if they cold have flipped something around inside to put the greatest heat elsewhere.Screen:  Nice improvement over the iPad2.  Makes reading easier on the eyes.  No more jagged fonts. When I go back to reading on my iPad 2, I wonder how in the word I managed with it.  Colors are more vibrant too.  I won't call is revolutionary, but it is a very nice upgrade.  At the end of the day, my iPad 2 would still be fine if I had never seen the iPad 3 screen.LTE:  This is a major selling point for me.  AT&T; LTE has been faster than both my home and work WiFi.  I did notice that LTE drains the battery very quickly, however.  I saw a 10% drop in battery within about 15 minutes while using LTE.  Battery drain was much slower when I jumped onto my work wifi.Overall:  I am happy with the new iPad, but I do find that I miss the smaller size and weight of the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 "disappears" when you use it, which was Steve Job's main objectives.  The iPad 3 does not have the same effect.  The screen pulls you in, but the extra heft becomes apparent more quickly.  IF the heft doesn't become noticeable, the heat will get your attention.  The heat is within acceptable limits, but it is there to remind you that you are holding an electronic device.  It's harder to get lost in that book or movie.  So if the magic of the iPad disappearing is important to you, then wait for the fourth gen which is bound to be lighter and cooler.  If you want a graphics and LTE workhorse that you will use on a table more than holding free-form in your hand, then the iPad 3 is a good choice.  Overall, I prefer the iPad 2 for the reason that it does disappear and pull you in.  Already waiting to see if the iPad 4 returns to this experience.	
147	4	2	3	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Nice Tablet, have a Kindle Fire to compare. This is a very nice tablet.  The screen is very clear and detailed.I have a Kindle Fire, so will compare that to the Ipad3.  I know they are priced much differently, but I have a Kindle and was questioning if the Ipad3 was a good upgrade.First the obvious:Apple has a bigger screen.IOS vs AndroidMain menus:The IPAD main menu scrolls smoother between screens and when opening applications.  The Kindle default Amazon interface is kind of lame and too simple, however I use a side loaded app called Go Launcher on the Kindle.Go Launcher has onscreen buttons for home and back (which is the same type of interface on an Android).  With the Ipad you have to press the hard button over to the side to go back to the home menu.On screen buttons like with Go Launcher are nice, example... if I am in email then open a url this will open up the web browser.  When I want to return back to that email I simply just press the onscreen back button while in web browser and this will take me back to the email I was just looking at.With the Ipad if you are in email and press on a url the web browser opens as normal, but you have to press the hard button to get out of the browser and back to the app menu, and then press the email app.  This seems kind of redundant to me.  Another option with the Ipad3 is you can hit the home button twice to access your open apps and press the email program.The Android onscreen navigation buttons are more intuitive for this purpose.Screen:The Kindle Fire screen looks very good but looking closely (12 inches away) I can still see the pixelation on smaller pictures.The Ipad Retina is for sure more clear and sharp.  The pictures are more vivid and detailed.  Text looks much sharper.Internet:Ipad3 web browsing is faster than the Kindle but there are still some occasional delays when scrolling down a webpage on the Ipad, but much less than the Kindle Fire.  Using the Safari browser is more responsive.  The larger screen on the IPAD3 is way nicer for web browsing.  With the Kindle Fire there is a lot more side scrolling going on and moving around the screen to browse the web.The onscreen keyboard:Ipad is very responsive and I don't feel like I have to guess if the onscreen key I hit was registered.The Kindle was not as responsive.  While the onscreen keyboard is good, there times when the Kindle just seems to hiccup and not register an onscreen key.Email:The Ipad built in email integrates with my MS Live account.The Kindle built in email doesn't work with MS Live, you have to get a different program which really sometimes does not pull up new email and the navigation is clunky.Music streaming:Pandora Radio works fine on both.  The Ipad has one speaker, and the Kindle has two for stereo affect.  The Kindle sound is very good for the price, but when tilted horizontally the speakers are on the left side and one of the speakers gets covered up when held up.  I think the Ipad3 sound is better, however the speaker faces away so the sound can be distant when propped up.Video streaming:Netflix on the Ipad3 is way better; the movies look clear and stream in HD.  The Kindle movies look blotchy and appear to be playing at a lower resolution.Google maps and locationing:Kindle Fire has no location positioning for locationing apps.The Ipad3, has no GPS, but can still use wireless positioning to locate the Ipad location like in Google Maps._____________So the Ipad3 is way better than the Kindle, surprise!!  My only gripe is there are no onscreen navigation buttons to jump to other applications.  Pressing the hard button is not a big issue, but I rather only use that button sparingly.I like the Ipad3 for most tasks including email, browsing the web, streaming movies.I like the Kindle Fire for compact use and I prefer the smaller size for traveling lightly.	
148	1	0	4	0	0	4	2	2	4	4	0	0	Apple customer service sucks. Apple customer service is a joke.  I purchased a new $600.00 Ipad2 on 2/19/12, the sound did not work.  I jumped through all of the hoops for Apple, sent it back for a replacement, and all I get for my trouble is lies (oh it is damaged and not covered by warranty ) and an attempt to scam more money out of me.  I am really ticked about this.  Contacting BBB, disputing with the credit card company, and contacting the local news.	
149	2	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	Ok upgrade. Upgraded from iPad 2. The new iPad has a noticeably better display. Important to me because of my photo hobby. Disappointed in the very slow recharge cycle and I don't notice any appreciable improvement in battery life between this iPad and my iPad 2. I do have issues with the iPad getting pretty hot during use. Since apple claims this is normal I'm willing to live with it but am not thrilled about how hot it gets either. I'm not sorry I upgraded but at the same time I'm not sure it was a necessary upgrade. I'm aware that I suffer from upgradeitous!	
150	2	4	3	4	4	0	4	2	4	2	4	4	New IPAD. I love my new ipad.  I use it every day and it is so easy to get around with it.  I am shocked that it did not come with a hard case or any screen protectors for a thousand dollars though.	
151	3	4	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	The New ipad, to be or not to be? My review is divided in to 2 parts. The pre purchase and the post purchase review.The prepurchase review:The release of the new iPad has left many of us in a state of indecisiveness. People who own, and those who have never owned an iPad are facing the same dilemma, to be or not to be. Most of us had high hopes that the new iPad would put an end to our life-long quest for an ideal tablet. Unfortunately, it did not. It now seems that the new iPad is more of an option rather than an upgrade to its predecessor. The market for iPad 2 therefore has not closed. In fact, even before the release of their 3rd generation tablet, apple had already announced that they will continue to manufacture iPad 2 and sell it at a reduced price.The purpose of this article is to help you decide whether you should buy the new iPad or stick with its predecessor. So, let us take a look at different scenarios where one version may be preferred over the other and vice versa. But first let's summarize all the important issues that have made the new iPad center of criticism.In the order of preference:1. overheating: it is now a common knowledge that the new iPad is running 13 degrees hotter than its predecessor. There can be two important implications of this issue. First, many people have pointed that they feel uncomfortable when holding the warm tablet for prolonged lengths of time. This feeling might become worse in the hot weather, especially when there is no AC to cool you and your iPad down. Imagine holding a sick child who has a fever of 102 degrees, but this baby is running a temperature of 116 degrees. Second, many have raise concerns over the effects of the high temperature on iPad's delicate hardware.2. Wifi connectivity: there are enough whiners on apple forum complaining about the new iPad's noticeably inferior wifi reception. For some this problem is more annoying than the heating issue.3. Battery: it takes twice the time to charge the new iPad to full than iPad 2. It has also been seen that the new iPad is falsely displaying a 100% charge figure when in fact it is continuing to load its battery for at least another hour after the percentage is displayed. Another, even bigger disappointment is the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy duty' app, such as games, videos or multitasking.4. Voracious appetite for data: being an HD model, understandably it needs more fuel to run than the previous models. I wish there was some kind of 'standard mode' that people could switch to inorder to conserve data, unfortunately, there isn't.5. Higher demand for memory: since most of its apps must be HD, and therefore 'heavy', the need for both static as well as Random Access Memory is naturally higher. Unfortunately, this entire HD concept has transcribed in to rendering the cheapest member of its family, the 16GB, more or less dysfunctional, at least for the aggressive tablet users. So if you want to buy anything 'functional' you must pick 32 GB or higher version.7. Few more ounces: This is not really a major issue but people who are used to holding the previous versions argue that the additional ounces further decrease the number of hours they could support the tablet on their palm. I personally believe that the heating factor would have kicked in way before you felt the strain from those few extra ounces.8. Same old dorky front camera: even though the rare camera has been upgraded the most functional camera of the iPad, the front camera, has been ignored. I completely fail to understand the logic behind this idea.9. Lack of Siri: most people were expecting to receive this iPhone 4S feature in their new iPad. But all they got was disappointment. Some people think that apple might have intentionally saved Siri for their next launch. However, apple has added a brand new feature to the new ipad, the dictation, and it may offset the disappointment to some extent. It is noteworthy to mention that both Siri and dictation need Internet connectivity to function.With this basic information about the new iPad it will now be easier for me to recommend the edition of the iPad that will suit your needs.So who should buy the new iPad?The biggest and perhaps the only visible plus of the new iPad thus far seems to be its display. All other features are more or less subdued by its lack of basic luxuries. For instance, the higher RAM feature is neutralized by the higher demand for memory, so on and so forth.So, if you are a digital photographer, the new iPad is the tablet of choice for you. No other display will give you even the closest visualization of the pixels that you captured.if you are a low to medium level surfer and like to read books and magazines with colorful graphics and display, the 3rd generation is the way to go.Game lovers who have extremely sensitive senses for sensing the speed, the new iPad is your gadget.If you are a big fan of shooting pictures and videos with your tablet (which is kind of odd, though), the new iPad is your tool. But you have to give me a genuinely convincing reason for choosing a tablet over a digital camera or even an iPhone to shoot quality photos and videos.Beyond this I would seriously recommend to meticulously outweigh risks verses benefits of buying the 3rd over 2nd generation iPad.And, who should buy the iPad 2? Well, everybody else who does not meet the above criterion. If you are an aggressive tablet user and must hold it for an infinite number of hours without having to bear the discomfort due to its higher temperature or weight or strain to your `retina', you are an born to use iPad 2.For intense ipad users a sluggish charge time is definitely going to be a deal breaker when purchasing the new iPad. Additionally, the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy' apps will add to its disability.For Navigation lovers, iPad 2 will certainly have an edge because of its quick charge time while you are on the go.People who live in wifi unfriendly homes should think twice before buying the new iPad.iPad 2 is light on your pocket if you are a big time GSM user. Since there are no unlimited data plans for iPad so one must use the data prudently to avoid being billed multiple times in a month. Both Verizon and AT&T; offer no more than 5 GB of data per charge for iPad. Here again the classification of aggressive vs low to medium user should help you decide between iPad 2 and the new iPad.If you are low on budget you could save a some money by choosing iPad 2. This is not only because of the recent price slash of iPad 2 but also due to the fact that the new iPad's higher memory requirement has only left you with the choice of purchasing its pricier version that has more memory.if you are a big time video chatter buying the new iPad will not make your experience any better than ipad 2 since no change has been made to the front camera of the tablet. Second, if you are chatting on a GSM plan you will now be burning more Mb/minute that you would with the previous version.Conclusion: Consider the New iPad if you are a big time digital photographer (professional or hobbyist) and if you are a low to medium tablet user. For everybody else, there is iPad 2.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The post-purchase review:I did eventually end up buying the new ipad. I took a chance and bought the least expensive third generation. I placed an order on the apple website and the item was shipped straight from China. The neat thing about this deal was the free personalized text engraving. I wrote 'Made for ...our names' and added my address to it as well.So, what is the deal with the New iPad? Well, to be honest, the heating issue was barely discernable but I really did not hag it to the limits so I am probably not the best person to pass the final verdict on the heating issue. But the real issue here was the display. Yes, 'issue'. I was quite disappointed to see how the pictures on various Internet sites appeared on the new ipad. Most of the facebook avatars appear fuzzy and ugly. People say that this effect is similar to the one we noticed when HD cameras first became available. They would magnify even the slightest wrinkle on your face and make you look darn ugly. But I am not the expert here, all I can say is I prefer my ipad 2 over the new ipad for facebook and picture surfing. Another important mention that I would like to make is about YouTube videos. Contrary to what one (me included) would have expected the new ipad is no better than ipad 2 in displaying even the highest resolution videos on YouTube. Infact the colors appear slightly distorted as compared to more natural looking ones on ipad 2. The new ipad does however have a slight edge over the ipad 2 when it comes to displaying high resolution pictures downloaded straight from high pixil DSLR camera.The next thing that I would definitely like to mention about the new ipad is its dictation feature. I must say that this is a great achievement. The transcription is more accurate than most other dictation apps. The best part is that this feature is integrated in to the keyboard so you do not have to open a seperate app to use it. You can use it almost anywhere where the keyboard pops up. But the question really is how many people will actually use this feature to make it a must-have option, I would say, not too many.I did not come across any issue with wifi connectivity. And, the thickness and heaviness was completely beyond my perception levels. With your eyes closed you can barely tell whether you are holding an ipad 2 or the new ipad. It even fit into the tragus leather case that is made for ipad 2 without ANY problems.And now I am sure most of you would like to ask me whether my opinion about the new ipad changed after I purchased it. My answer would be NO. I still think that all the 'yummy' features that the new ipad has been stuffed with are 'optional' and do not justify the release of a brand new version. People could have comfortably lived with the iPad 2 for another 2-3 years.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	
152	2	4	3	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Awesome Tablet. The 3rd Generation iPad or what Apple wants to call "The New iPad".  I don't need the 3G/Wi-Fi version so I purchased the 16GB Wi-Fi only version. Nothing changed on the design compared to the iPad 2 but the New iPad is a hairline thicker. What's great with The New iPad is the new faster processor (A5x), Improved Camera and the Retina Display.The new Apple A5x chip is awesome. It runs at a 1GHz dual core processor and a Quad Core GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) with 1GB of RAM which delivers a very great responsive experience.  It is very quick on opening applications, watching videos or playing games.The Retina display resolution is 2048 x 1536 which doubles the resolution of the iPad2.  Has a bright contrast and great viewing angles.  No problems using it outdoors, great for reading and watching movies.  You also get Video Out (using the charger slot on the buttom) on the New iPad but you need to get an optional digital AV adapter to get that feature to work.Love the Camera: The new improve 5MP iSight Camera which features an F2.4 lens sensor with back side lumination. The shutter button is now position on the right side for easy access compared from the previous one which is located on the buttom. Another improvement is the 1080p High Definition Video Recorder which moves at 29 frames per second.  It also has an Anti-Shake features to help capture that great video even if you have that shaky hands.Voice Dictation Service is another new feature if you don't want to type your messages, great for that long email replies.If you get the AT&T; or Verizon version, the micro sim slot card is on the left side of the tablet.Another great aspect that I love with the new iPad is Battery Life. I used it for a solid 2 days and watched a lot of movies.Giving this new iPad a 5 stars!!!	
153	4	2	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	Horrible Device For Basic Business Needs!  Too many restrictions! I've had my new iPad for a couple weeks now & I am constantly having road blocks doing basic everyday functions.  Don't be fooled by the slick design & nice screen display, this device has so many limitations compared to other cheaper devices.I think it's good for an entertainment device but it's horrible for business. Here's why....The iPad does not allow a basic way to attach a file to an email.The iPad does not allow a way to upload any content through a web browser. Example, if you wanted to upload your current resume to a career site, there is no way for iPad to do so.  You would have to use your computer or an android device.I'm shocked in 2012 with a hi tech device I'm unable to do the most basic everyday functions.I tested out some cheaper android tablets & they all seem to do the basic internet functions with no problem; even the Kindle Fire!?. Email attachment, upload & download files through the web browser.  All web content is not hosted through iTunes so the restrictions is a big headache.  If you do any business through email & web browsers, do not travel without a laptop.	
154	2	2	0	4	0	2	4	4	3	2	4	4	LATEST APPLE iPAD. Apple iPad MD328LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) NEWEST MODELI purchased this for my wife who has used it constantly. We took a short trip this unit provided music and directions that was not on the car I was delivering. It is easy to use, up date and store data.	
155	2	4	3	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	apple iPad. I recently bought my husband an iPad for his birthday. The iPad is great but the support from apple is about the worst I have ever encountered, they are hard to get to and once you do you have to go through automation for about 5 to 10 minutes and then you can speak to a person. I am very upset with this support system, I guess Amazon has spoiled me because I can talk to a person right away. So if you buy an iPad make sure you know all the ins and outs of the item before you buy it.	
156	4	4	3	0	0	3	2	2	3	2	4	4	Buying from Amazon. The product is excellent and meets all my Granddaughter's needs.I am writing the review to comment upon the appalling service from Amazon. This purchase was charged to my credit card. Unfortunately we managed to purchase 2 and the one I bought was returned to Amazon. Amazon they gave a gift voucher to my daughter in law for the net of returns amount. I gave instructions to credit my credit but this was ignored. Hopeless admin from Amazon!	
157	2	3	4	0	4	1	4	4	3	4	4	4	Love the iPad. wish we had purchased a WiFI booster to go with our iPad which would give us greater range outside the house	
158	4	2	4	4	3	2	4	4	2	4	0	0	Wi-Fi does not work. The "new iPad" is pure junk and I would not recommend to anybody. The main issue is the Wi-Fi which simply does not work. I have an iPad 2, iPhone, and a Wi-Fi television we watch Netflix on. Each on these units receive Wi-Fi signals without problems (they are all within 5 feet of each other) but not the "new iPad". I got this for my wife who is recently wheelchair bound so she could check her email, surf the Internet, and play games. The only thing it is good for is playing games, which does not require a Wi-Fi connection.I am going to contact Amazon about returning, I would take it to an Apple store but cannot leave my wife.  If you have the misfortune of purchasing one of these I wish you good luck.	
159	0	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	WOW. I gave this the highest rating for several reasons. One being I had not used any iPads before I bought this. I'm astounded about how easy this version is to use. I can do everything, just about, that I can do on the computer. I could go on and on but you got the idea. Delivery was outstanding, had it within a few days.	
160	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	Great price. It is for my daughter for Christmas, and I can't wait to see her face when she opens it! Merry Christmas!	
161	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	4	4	4	Was a gift for in-laws. Since it was a gift, I don't know how it is working for them. I believe it is fine, will find out more later.	
162	4	2	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Who doesn't like iPads. It was a gift for my wife and the clarity is unbelievably better that the original.  I dont have to say more.  Buy it.	
163	4	0	2	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	There is no such thing as an ipad 3. Bought this product and found out that apple doesnt even make an ipad 3. only ipad2 and the newest version ipad with retina display.lol what a joke their creating there own apple products.	
164	4	4	3	4	4	1	2	4	4	1	4	4	no cancel. sir i don't want to cancel it more i will take itis it possible sir i hope that it will shiped by 11 januari	
165	4	0	2	1	4	0	1	4	3	4	2	2	Very good. Very good product.  The camera button takes more than one touch to work.  Also I notice the lower left corner is slow to work.  I may not have the right touch but I noticed everything else works on the first touch.  Thank you,	
166	0	0	2	0	4	4	4	0	4	2	1	1	Poor wi fi performance and customer service. My IPAD 3 wi fi constantly slows down or loses connectivity after fifteen minutes in public wi fi spots. It does well at home.  In hotspots it's unusable.  I went twice to the apple store and a genius did a reset of wi fi networks, went out to test, no better, returned and requested an exchange as its still under warranty. The manager said their "process"requires a total system reset first.  So they reset it and I had to leave.  Still no good.Contrast this with customer service with Verizon where I had a defective earphone jack on a droid phone.  They took my word for it, shipped a new phone out immediately and a container to return the old phone.  You bet I will stay with them.My next tablet will be an Android.  Apple no longer has a monopoly on tablets which seems to elude them.A also have a Kindle Fire HD which is great.  I will have to make a third trip to the Apple store which is not convenient.After my third trip to the Apple store, they honored the warranty and gave me a new and working iPad 3.  I must say, the apps for the iPad work very well  give it an edge for now.	
167	4	4	3	4	1	0	0	4	4	3	3	3	I like it...but. I am not sure what I was expecting. It seems to be more or less just a large iphone. This not necesssarily bad, I just thought there was more. Perhaps there is, lets give it time.	
168	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	4	4	3	4	4	A+ Everthing went well! Great product as described. Will do business again. Awesome company to do business with. The product was exactly what we wanted. Thanks.	
169	2	2	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	2	4	4	Great but whats with the price? Why would I buy a third generation ipad that is more expensive than a fourth generation ipad at best buy?	
170	4	4	4	4	3	2	1	3	2	4	4	4	So far enjoying. So far I like it a lot still kind of getting used to using it but hoping that once I get it all figured out it will be perfect	
171	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	Another great tablet. I have 3 iPads, 1 Kindle fire, 1 Acer Iconia and 1 Kindle. This is my second most favorite! Well thought out. Beautiful craftsmanship. Works great with iCloud. Very easy to find accessories (covers, adapters, etc.).	
172	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	3	4	2	4	4	Everything. It came quickly. It's exactly as great as you'd imagine. It was just what I needed after my laptop stopped working.	
173	2	3	4	0	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	love my ipad. the ipad 3 is soooo gooood!!! its fast and face time is great some apps i recommend ....abc player...ibooks...iheartradio...and netflix...and a game is bike baron.....if your thinking about an ipad 4 dont wasting your money!!..all it has is a lightning charger !! rip off ..ipad 3 so much better .... i recommend this case22 pcs iPad 3 Accessory Bundle / 360° Black Leather Case, Smoke TPU Case, Black Silicone Case / Earphones / 4 Silver and Blue Stylus Pens! / Chargers for iPad 3 - ECO-FUSED® Microfiber Cleaning Cloth Included - And MORE! Also compatible with iPad 2 (Black)	
174	4	4	4	2	4	0	1	4	4	2	4	4	Great. I already own a Kindle Fire, but this allows everything the Kindle does plus more! Wish I'd bought it first, but my husband loves the Fire as it's small enough for him to carry on trips!!	
175	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Great Item. Product was what my wife had in mind--what a powerful Ipad for the money! It was a birthday present and she was very surprised and happy with the unit.	
176	1	4	2	4	3	4	0	4	4	0	2	2	Pricey but overvalued. As long as you don't mind the computer telling you what you are going to do this is a good device to own. I used some of the available apps in my business and find it very convenient.	
177	0	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	love it. As mentioned like new, no scratch found just like new, except the box look a little old, other than that every things are fine.	
178	3	4	4	3	2	3	1	1	0	4	3	3	It is a very user friendly device. The only reason that I gave it a 4 star, is because being accostumed to the Windows environment I like flexibility and expandability.  The only way you can put more memory in this thing is by buying a more expensive model, really?	
179	2	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	2	4	4	So far so good. I can't complain? Works just the way I expected it to. I think the white is really cute . Thanks	
180	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	3	3	Nice piece of kit. This is a nice piece of kit, the screen is clear and photos and videos look really crisp, the OS seems stable and there are countless good apps and games in the appstore to keep you busy and entertained. Email works great and internet is great on a tablet. Bit of a hefty price tag tho. I found a great book on getting started with iPads Using iPad (Computer Training)	
181	1	1	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	A hopped up semi-smart phone. PROSWell BuiltNice DisplayGood Touch screenCONSNO USB portEven at 64GB you don't have enough memory to do muchFront facing camera sucksRear facing camera is marginalNo zoom or flash on rear facing cameraNeeds aftermarket keyboard if you wish to type anything longer than a sentence or twoCharger get's VERY hot when you chargePOWER HOG - don't expect more than a few hours of video playback no matter what other people claim. And if you are using GPS and DATA streaming forget it, this thing sucks down the battery like crazy.Battery indicator lies - when it gets to 100% you are really at about 90%, keep charging for at least another 1-2 hours to get a full charge.Bottom LineIt's basically a hopped up smart phone with a bigger screen. Fun for face time, basic emails, watching YouTube videos or to play games but in reality it doesn't have enough computing power, memory or a functional keyboard to be useful as a mini-computer.EDIT: After Apple released the new IOS and it's subsequent update I have lowered my rating. NOT because the new IOS is bad but because of the stupid way it updates. Before you would update the IOS and the IOS only, now you have to completely wipe the IPAD's memory even for the littlest update (last one they added a Greek keyboard). That means you lose EVERYTHING on your IPad and you have to download it ALL again. That's right, every song, picture, app, data, video, magazine, kindle book, etc. etc. etc. But not before you have to input you Wi-Fi password (for every Wi-Fi account you use) and your apple account and password, not once but three times in order to even start using your IPad. For me to reprogram all of the passwords, restore all of the apps and re-download all of the data takes about 8 hours on a pretty high-speed connection of clicking on apps. This is CRAZY and for that reason alone it loses another star.Sorry apple the more I use your products the more infuriating they become.

Be very wary of purchasing any tech products from TechGiant.Purchased a 3rd gen ipad from them via Amazon and 8 months later the speaker stopped working.  Contacted Apple with the ipad's serial number and they said it did not exist or was never registered.  Ask TechGiant for assistance and they said they do not offer any warranty over the standard 30 days via Amazon.I asked TechGiant about the 1-year warranty on hardware that comes with all Apple products and TechGiant said that they cannot honor that as they do not know how long the devices have been sitting on their own shelf.  They said that if they bought the ipad from their distributor 6 months before a customer buys it on Amazon from them, there would only be 6 months left on the Apple warranty.This is absolutely not stated on the product page and we were VERY DISAPPOINTED with TechGiant!!!BUYER BEWARE of TechGiant!!!  Ask the how long the "new" device has been sitting on their "shelf" before they sell it to you.  I would never deal with this seller again.  You are better off buying directly from the Apple store.

I am a solo attorney and it has helped with my organization and efficiency which is critical for a busy solo. In particular, I've stopped taking notes on paper. I used to have legal pads littering my office but I've consolidated all my note taking and exclusively use my iPad. I also download research and, although I don't handle much litigation, I did get the opportunity to use my iPad at a hearing. The judge even commented on it.Plants vs Zombies 2 and Flipboard aren't bad either :-)

I haven't had a problem with it yet and it is truly a nice piece of hardware. One of the only issues I can point out is the rear facing speaker, but there are ways to fix that.

196	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	4	Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead? UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are "post-paid" and "pre-paid."  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can "suspend" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.	
197	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	0	4	4	4	Worth the wait! I have always wanted an ipad. The clarity of the screen is amazing! I can't wait to take videos of the grandkids. It's so easy to travel with, no more headaches from carrying around a heavy laptop.	
198	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	1	4	4	0	0	Look What It Did To Me!!!!!!!!!! This  Ipad was amazing because as soon as I bought I thought it would be great... It turned about that I was wrong. I let my baby use it and it broke. As soon as I told my wife she went into to cardiac arrest and my baby turned into a werewolf. I was soon over taken by the zombies that made a cult in my basement. The whole city of Southboro was OVERTAKEN AND I HAD TO MOVE. In recap the Ipad made me lose my wife my baby and my house (Not to mention the city of Southboro).	
199	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	4	4	4	4	4	Ipad 3. Great service,  good tracking arrived on time.  Packed very good great product was a gift for wife and she is loving it.	
200	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	0	3	4	4	4	Can not be replaced with the MacBook Air. As much as I liked my iPad 1, I thought MacBook Air 11 would be a more practical choice in term of upgrade. However, very soon after buying MacBook Air and giving my iPad 1 away I realized that I really missed my iPad (another thing I thought would help me to deal without it was a 4.5 LG Spectrum Phone).I was concerned about the New iPad being a bit more bulky than iPad 2 and getting warm as some people complained. Waiting until a new version of iPad is released seemed like a good idea, but I decided to go for it and buy the New iPad anyways. No regrets: it is not bulkier than my older ipad 1, and even though I do feel the warmth on its back and wish it was not there, the high resolution screen makes up for it and would probably compensate for more problems if there were more ones.The iPad definitely has the niche of its own: as small as MacBook Air 11 is, it is not the same. New iPad has a way better screen, nicer form factor (for reading and for browsing), and does not get overheated as quickly (my MBA would turn its fan almost right away as I start watching a video on it). If you have to compromise and have only one device, MBA is a better choice of course because it is a computer, not a mobile device. But as a second device iPad works really well.	
201	4	4	4	3	4	0	4	3	4	3	4	4	Multipurpose electronic tool. I am going on a trip- and to be able to read a book, watch a movie, check emails etc on one electronic device is fab.  I have not bought an IPhone - I tend to not be able to hold on to phones but my IPad is great.  When I visit the children I do not have to take my Laptop the Ipad serves all of my needs.	
202	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	Best Apple Ipad Ever! This Apple Ipad first generation is perfect for people who have kids. As a child with four siblings, I know this is true.  It is only about a few centimeters thick and can contain all the games you love, your calendar, the internet, and so much more. It isn't too small so that you can't read anything on it, but it isn't too big so you can take it places.  You can download games for the kids and have your apps also. My mom and dad will use the Ipad when they need to look something up or check the calendar. I love to play card games and watch movies on Netflix. Everyone in my family has their own app that they can always go on.  The only downside is how the internet connection is set up. My older siblings and I like to go on the internet to check our emails and facebooks. On the ipad first generation you can't get on the internet unless you have wifi. When we are on road trips we can't see what our friends are up to.  The people who wouldn't like this product would be people who need internet connection everywhere they go. That's alright because there is another ipad for that, but for me the Apple Ipad first generation is perfect for me.	
203	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	1	4	2	4	4	FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY NEPHEW, WHO GAVE ME HOPE WHEN I NEEDED IT.  HE LOVES THIS IPAD AND SAID THAT IT WAS THE "TOP OF THE LINE".  HE'S WANTED ONE FOR A WHILE NOW AND I AM GLAD I WAS ABLE TO MAKE HIM HAPPY WITH IT!	
204	0	4	4	0	4	1	4	2	0	2	0	0	SELLER ISSUE - NOT NEW AS ADVERTISED BUT USED - BUYERS BEWARE. problem with seller not Apple. I ordered the new ipad (brand new). It arrived the very next day. The package was slightly damaged. I wanted to buy the protection plan from Apple and so I contacted them. Apple told me that this product is already registered in their system and it is a used product. I was surprised to hear that. Upon contacting the seller, they never offered me a brand new ipad. They said if I keep this ipad they will give 25$ store credit or 3 year protection plan. I am returning the product now (shipping cost by me). buyers beware.one thing I noticed is the seller changes the name frequently. I would recommend buying Apple products from name brand store.	
205	4	4	2	1	3	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	Wonderfull and useful toy. Complements  a computer , but doesn't  substitute for one. Magic touch gives unprecedented feeling of power.Great to search the internet, pay bills,video communications,etc  Lacks the power and versatility of a computer. Not for serious  work but indispensable as a personal aid. The applelets are useful and fun. All in all an excellent addition to the necessary gadgets of the new brave world.	
206	2	0	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	2	4	4	iPad works!!! still works, use it every day, several hours a day. dropped several times - no problems.the only problem, it takes several trials to install upgrade (3 to 4 attempts).	
207	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	3	4	Excellent! I would first like to say I DID NOT purchase this item on amazon because the markup is silly high. I have read allot of the amazon reviews and feel that some reviewers are very unfair on the product. So with that said please read my review if you are considering buying.I bought the 32GB wifi and Verizon 4G in whiteI currently own the retina display iPad in whiteIn the past I have owned the galaxy tab 10.1, the Samsung ativ pc pro, galaxy note, and kindle 8.9 HDI love the iPad mini. I think it is very practical for everyday use. It is easy to hold, battery life is excellent, typing is easy, equipped with a few movies, a few games, and the kindle AP you always have entertainment wherever you go in a small and beautiful form factor.Many people are raising a fuss about the non-retina display... This does not bother me even though my primary device before the mini has been the retina iPad. You can see pixels, it's not so beautifully crisp as the retina but it is still above adequate for reading, gaming, etc. after an hour or so of using this device I don't even notice the difference. I owned the kindle fire, and while the screen was HD and looked great I couldn't stand how tied to Amazon I was with it (sorry amazon I love you)  and well... I had other issues with it as well.Some people are claiming the device is slow especially when buffering utube. I have not seen any difference in speed from my iPad 3. As far as gaming goes words with friends is the only game I play and it works flawlessly on the mini. Perhaps if your buying the iPad for gaming you would be happier with the iPad 4 ( or whatever they are calling it) because it has more RAM and a faster processor.The form factor of theMini is simply amazing, I honestly can't complain about the lack of retina because I think that's too much to ask right now for any manufacturer to get into such a slim and light package. You honestly can't truly understand how amazing this thing is until you have used an iPad 3 for a significant amount of time, the weight and bulk gets to you. The iPad mini fits so well into my purse and I can hold it easily for hours with one hand. I can read and rock my child to sleep at the same time now!You should only get the wifi version unless you have a share everything plan as my husband and I do, then you can ad your tablet on for a low fee to your existing plan. I would never pay 30 dollars a month for a separate plan. I love that you can use FaceTime over the 3G or 4G, I tuck this into my purse and if my son is doing something particularly cute on the playground during daddies lunch break we can call him and say "hi".As far as cases go, I am a minimalist so I love the Smart Cover paired with a clear plastic back so I don't cover up the beauty of my mini. The Smart Cover is different from my iPad 3 smart over, the hinge does to have any metal showing and it snaps on tighter and looks much nicer. I tried the Griffin thin case folio (I think that was what it's called) it was really nice looking but when the mini was in it it didn't lie flat hindering some of my key presses on the outer edge of the device. I recently read a review on this product and the man raved about it, so maybe I just got a faulty case.Apple care+ feels like a must on this device. Because I will be carrying this wherever I go and because its so slim I want to cover my a** if I drop this beautiful piece of equipment. If I bought the 16GB wifi only version I might not pay the extra dough for AppleCare +.The speakers really surprised me on this little device, they are loud and clear! I still wish Apple would include headphones in every package as well as an adapter for the new power connector (we all know Apple is stingy) but they don't.I am really excited about this device, I could have saved money and purchased a google nexus 7 or any one of the other 7 inch devices but their battery life, build quality, and battery life are inferior to the mini. (Yes I am sure someone will send a nasty comment when they read this about me being an isheep) I don't stand behind a product simply because it is made by a certain company, I stand behind a product when it is a damn good product. I recognize the mini has some shortcomings but they far outweigh the greatness of this beautiful product.	
208	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	0	4	4	4	Love my iPad. I bought an iPad because I really wanted the ability to take digital notes in my classes and not have to carry around 5 different notebooks along with everything else for my classes. I bought a stylus to go along with my iPad and I love taking notes on it.Along with taking notes I am able to keep digital versions of all my books on my iPad so when I go to school I am able to take just my iPad to class with me and not have to worry about remembering each book for the day.Aside from loving the iPad for use at school it is as great as everyone else makes it out to be. Being able to watch movies and play games on it makes it a great all around tool for me to use at school. When I'm not in class or studying I can use it to take a break and play a few games.	
209	1	0	4	4	4	2	4	4	3	0	3	3	Good with one exception. The product itself is fine but as I ordered a black one I expected a black one. Only the face is black, the case behind is silver/aluminium colour and gives off reflections which I was trying to avoid.	
210	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	2	3	4	4	4	Very pleased with this purchase. This was a very pleasant surprise.  I was apprehensive about a used ipad but the product looks like it was just received directly from the manufacturer; no scratches, marks, dents or any evidence or prior use.  It more than met my expectations - at a very fair price.	
211	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	Perfect! Almost new ipad for an used ipad price! I am rating using it now :) very happy with my new toy!	
212	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	2	3 star. I would say my experience has been 3 star, but that is because of my lack of knowledge of how to work it. I wish it came with more (any) general information instead of having to look EVERYTHING up on line. You have to know how to use electronics before you own it - don't get that ... I guess I'm showing my age!We had a very difficult time connecting with our server. Eventually it just worked, and we have no understanding of why it didn't and then one day - did. If my daughter hadn't spent so much time working on it, I would have given up, turned it off and shipped it back.	
213	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	3	4	3	4	4	I really love my iPad. I use my iPhone for news video clip, reading books and documents, and surfing the web. I wish a version of MS Office were available for writing and editing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. (The apps available are of mediocre quality).	
214	3	1	4	4	0	1	2	2	4	2	3	3	Not much different. The product is good -slim enough etc. but I don't see much difference compared to earlier models -I still have the old generation	
215	4	4	4	4	0	2	4	4	2	4	4	4	Very good. I was on a tight schedule when I purchased this product, had to select two day shipping and honestly was a bit apprehensive until the product arrived exactly at the expected time. The ipad itself was as good as new and came along with the box and everything. Overall it was a very good deal.	
216	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	2	4	2	4	4	Great Product! I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband, and he absolutely LOVES it! He takes it with him everywhere he goes. The picture is outstanding and the sound is great too. I do recommend getting a Life Proof case for this!	
217	4	4	4	3	4	2	4	0	4	3	4	4	Great upgrade from old version. I've had every iPad that came out and this one is awesome. I had the iPad 3rd generation wifi only for a while and I was needing to use data on my train rides and decided to get a new iPad. Settling for a iPad LTE carrier was easy for me. I chose AT&T; because I already have the iPhone 5 under that carrier. The speed is amazing and I love it!	
218	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	3	4	4	4	I LOVE THIS! I'm still not totally sure what to do with this...but I love being able to pick it up and search for something that I just heard or seen.  My husband says it is a $500 Game Boy for me...and that is somewhat true...but am trying to use it for more useful things!  Still love it anyway!	
219	4	4	4	3	4	4	2	2	2	2	4	4	As Expected. arrived in sealed box in new condition.  turned on and started using immediately.  performs as expected.  no surprises.  great purchase.	
220	4	4	1	3	3	4	4	2	4	2	3	3	Good. Very good, responsive and everything works fine, Can't go wrong with Apple! I'm actually using it to write this review c:	
221	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	high resolution. i prefer this over ipad 2 or ipad mini due to its retina display. it works like charm and running apps without lag	
222	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	Perfect Shipping,  and Works Great. I stayed with the iPad 3 to keep my connection cables all the same as my other apple devices.  The Retina display is fantastic, aand the unit functioned great out of the box.	
223	4	2	2	0	4	2	2	1	4	0	4	4	Nice product. I love this product, its work fine and I received it in the estimated date and time. Also, it is a nice product

226	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	4	Ones upon a time. I always wanted a iPad but fell in love with the kindle fire hd so much I bought two one 7 inch and 1 8.9 .They were pure entertainment devices and very family friendly but they did have there limitations.My work required me to have access to apps that the fire didn't  have  increasing my need for a full tablet experience with that said I did keep my 7 inch fire hd.I love hd entertainment and the iPad didn't disappoint me at all yes I did pay more for the iPad for the extras I needed but its the real deal if you have the luxury of having a fire hd 7 inch and a 10 inch iPad do it because the I pad mini is not a fire hd.Now that I told you my story I have to say the iPad retina has been with me every where I go my tablet is no longer my bedtime device it's a part of my life and yes it does everything it should do well movies ,music ,apps and more and it does it very well .I believe that until someone makes a device that is easy to use and is main stream the 9.7 inch iPad will remain the best tablet on the marketEveryone competes and compares there tablet with the iPad the reason is  they have to its that good but most important you need a tablet in today's world .As a Amazon customer I didn't want to write this review but respectfully I will say if you want a pure entertainment device the 8.9 fire hd is a excellent tablet for half the money and it was totally out of need that I spent the extra money for the iPad and you will have to buy a iPad to even be close to a amazon product or buy both .My only regret was I had to buy a used open box item described as like new and it was like very used in fair and dirty condition the power cord was crazy dirty the tablet had the dirtiest box and finger prints all over the glass it did clean up well but it was only $10.00 less then the same one new at apples online store with a one year warranty but I only found that out after I bought it .Service with amazon is one of the best online and maybe I got the wrong iPad because they sell good,very good, and like new and anything I ever bought like new was either new or real close  who knows maybe after this review they may offer me a new one .Remember the iPad is a great tablet there is no way you won't like it but for the small difference maybe you should buy new and get the real experience .It's like staying in the best hotel and getting a bad room .I plan to give a update so stay tune.

PROSWell BuiltNice DisplayGood Touch screenCONSNO USB portEven at 64GB you don't have enough memory to do muchFront facing camera sucksRear facing camera is marginalNo zoom or flash on rear facing cameraNeeds aftermarket keyboard if you wish to type anything longer than a sentence or twoCharger get's VERY hot when you chargePOWER HOG - don't expect more than a few hours of video playback no matter what other people claim. And if you are using GPS and DATA streaming forget it, this thing sucks down the battery like crazy.Battery indicator lies - when it gets to 100% you are really at about 90%, keep charging for at least another 1-2 hours to get a full charge.Bottom LineIt's basically a hopped up smart phone with a bigger screen. Fun for face time, basic emails, watching YouTube videos or to play games but in reality it doesn't have enough computing power, memory or a functional keyboard to be useful as a mini-computer.EDIT: After Apple released the new IOS and it's subsequent update I have lowered my rating. NOT because the new IOS is bad but because of the stupid way it updates. Before you would update the IOS and the IOS only, now you have to completely wipe the IPAD's memory even for the littlest update (last one they added a Greek keyboard). That means you lose EVERYTHING on your IPad and you have to download it ALL again. That's right, every song, picture, app, data, video, magazine, kindle book, etc. etc. etc. But not before you have to input you Wi-Fi password (for every Wi-Fi account you use) and your apple account and password, not once but three times in order to even start using your IPad. For me to reprogram all of the passwords, restore all of the apps and re-download all of the data takes about 8 hours on a pretty high-speed connection of clicking on apps. This is CRAZY and for that reason alone it loses another star.Sorry apple the more I use your products the more infuriating they become.

229	4	4	4	3	4	0	3	3	4	2	4	4	Love my I pad use it mostly instead of computer. Can use I pad for all my computer work and also easier to play games on my grand children love it	
230	0	3	0	4	0	3	0	2	4	2	4	4	love it. I pretty much decided this is the best gift to my family members. Each receiver loves this iPad. Even my 82 years-old mother loves it. shipping is fine, no major issues. I don't remember which one, there was one that has shipping damage, and I had to buy one from different seller. since I bought a few already, I don't remember which is which. my advice is that contact the seller first before you place the order, make sure the seller pack the original box really well.	
231	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	2	3	4	Great tablet. Got this for a really good price and with minimal damage. Works great and I can use it for both work and play. Takes a little getting used to how to use it, but I'm enjoying it a lot

After numerous attempts to solve with ATT finally brought it into an Apple Store.Apple Tech informed me it was hardware issue and would have to be replaced. No problem, I just got this 3 months ago, iPads have a 1 year limited warrantyTurns out the warranty EXPIRED June 1st 2013., 2 months before I bought it, and the seller completely failed to include that very important bit of information.Nice.	
233	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	4	2	4	4	4	Love it! I got this for my bf and he loves it!! It was kind of a bummer it didn't come in its original box but nonetheless a great gift.	
234	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	0	0	This iPad seriously makes me wonder if it was stolen! I have had NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT I RECEIVED THIS IPAD!! It crashes for the simplest of reasons and is just a complete headache! I do not know or understand what the problem is seeing as though I have reset this contraption more than once and still deal with the same issues! I wish that I had paid closer attention to the return date because I definitely would have asked for another iPad or a refund!! Just overall disappointed and frustrated.	
235	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	0	4	4	Love it. I am very satisfied.  The screen is in pristine condirion.  Everything worked perfectly! Great buy!  Only downside - I am not keeping it, as it is for my sister.	
236	2	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	0	2	4	A little disappointed .... The 'scratches' mentioned in the description were cracks but works great. The price reflected the condition but the truth would've been less of a surprise.	
237	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	Great. I got this iPad for my dad and he absolutely loves it. when he is home on his day off, he won't put it down.	
238	4	3	2	0	4	1	1	4	0	1	4	4	Totally worth upgrading from iPad 1st generation or if you have never had an iPad before! This is the iPad to get. If you have never owned an iPad before or are still using your 1st generation iPad, it is time to give in and buy one of these babies. The screen is beautiful. You know your nice HD tv at home? This has 1 million MORE pixels than that TV! It's got 1GB of ram, a faster A5X processor, and still manages to keep the 10 hour battery life! What more can you ask for?This is one of the best travel devices ever. Load it up with some games, movies, music, magazines and even books! You can travel internationally and not have to worry about running out of battery mid flight.  I love my iPad and it will continue to go with me on every flight I make to keep me entertained.	
239	4	3	2	2	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	Amazing Retina Display. I had the original iPad for a couple of months back in 2010 and really liked to browse the web on it. When I heard the new one is coming out, I preordered the white ATT 64GB from Apple website. I received it on the launch day two weeks ago, and I am really enjoying the new Retina display ever since. It is such an improvement over the first iPad, and I really enjoy reading different things on it.Color Choice:My original iPad was black, but this time against all the online suggestions, I went for the white version. My reasoning was, if you really want to read something--either web or text--having black borders only makes your eyes hurt even more. Printed books do not have black borders, and yet they are the easiest to read. I am happy to report that my intuition was right, and the white version is easier on my eyes for reading purposes. Maybe it is not the best for playing video games or watching movies, but the white border actually helps the reading. In addition, it is not completely white and has a beautiful pinkish hue that looks like pearl from some angles.Connectivity and Speed:I could connect to both of my router 2 GHz and 5 GHz channels via Wi-Fi. Out of curiosity, I inserted my modified T-Mobile SIM card into the GSM spot, and it did pick T-Mobile internet but worked only on 2G (Edge) mode. It works very well with Apple TV 3, and I was able to duplicate the iPad screen with my 40" LCD. However, the screen aspect ratio was only 4/3 and not 16/9.This new iPad is much faster than my original iPad. I can even browse the web much faster on this version let alone other programs and games. I ordered the Camera Connection Kit alongside this iPad, and it can import and read my 24MP pictures from Sony A77 without any problems.Cameras:My original iPad didn't have any camera, so it is so much fun to use FaceTime and the back camera. Both of them are quality cameras, although I don't see much use of the backside camera. I have my iPhone for that application. Maybe if you want to shoot movies and edit on the iPad itself, it is worth to have a good quality rear camera.Problems:I use international keyboards sometimes to enter foreign characters into the search, and I encountered several crashes when changing keyboard in Safari. One time I was writing a paragraph in Notes app, and suddenly the app crashed because I accidentally clicked on international icon. The problem was, I lost all the text I typed. I think the new iOS needs some minor bug fixes.Verdict:It is the best tablet I've ever used. It is fast and responsive, light, and it has an excellent LCD which is easy on your eyes. Does it worth the price? It depends. Like any other Apple products, this is made from high quality materials, and it is stylish. Paying the price is hard, but once you start using it, all the fun begins. Hope you could find valuable information in my mini review.	
240	0	0	3	2	4	1	4	0	2	4	0	4	Good way of wasting money. First of all I want to point out that I own an Ipad (first edition) and Ipad2. I need a tablet primarily to work with e-mail, read and listen to the news (cnbc and others), watch movies and listen to the music on the go. And if a product is well made and of good quality I'm not going to buy something else just because it is NEW, but actually doesn't offer substantially better experience. Not only new Ipad doesn't offer something that would made it different from previous models (for example possibility of installing  windows , or Adobe Flash etc.), but I have serious doubts about its quality. Based on my previous experience the quality of first Ipad is not that good ( It worked well for almost 2 years, but then one day just died), and I doubt that Ipad 3 quality is any better. I am most certainly not going to be buying a tablet that has 2 years life period (and who knows maybe even less). And it really pisses me off that a lot of times instead of graphics and charts you see empty space or you cannot listen to an interview. In my opinion right now Apple is making money on a smart marketing strategy, but not on an innovative product.	
241	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	Great at what it is intended to do. If you like reading books, watching TV shows or Movies, and playing games, then this device is perfect. However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about. I've rarely had difficulty finding a hot spot at any destination I've travelled to.	
242	3	4	3	4	4	0	4	1	1	4	2	4	It's just a shame! Connection and Photo Syncing Annoyances. I actually bought the Ipad 3, 64GB wi-fi version from Apple maybe a month or so ago.  Long story short is that I absolutely love the Ipad for everything it can do, BUT, there were two reasons why I ultimately returned it:1. Connections:  I still really find it annoying that the only connection you have to this Ipad is the normal connection as seen on every single previous version of the Ipad.  Look, I know there is that adapter that you can buy separately that connects a USB cord to the Ipad as well as the SD card as well:[...]But, the general public that has bought the item specifically for the Ipad 3 are consistently complaining that it is very shotty and doesn't really work.2. THE BIG ONE!!!:  Itunes and the TERRIBLE interface when trying to sync photos from your computer (either PC or Mac ... and for me specifically a PC with Windows 7, 64bit), to the Ipad 3.  Not, Ipad 2, I'm taking about the Ipad 3.  Why is nobody complaining about this HUGE problem on this site?  If you don't believe me, just type in "Ipad 3 Photo Syncing Problem" on Google, and be amazed.  If you want to save the time, click on the below link which will take you directly to the blog as discussed on Apple's own community website.[...]Just start from that page and read on through 23 other pages, of complaints with this issue.  Some people offered solutions, some worked, but the bottom line is is that Apple continues to deny this problem, and there has been no recent fix/update with Itunes to remedy it.  Even though Itunes update 10.6.1 says:About iTunes 10.6.1iTunes 10.6.1 provides a number of improvements, including:* Fixes several issues that may cause iTunes to unexpectedly quit while playing videos, changing artwork size in Grid view, and syncing photos to devices.So, all in all, once Apple fixes this issue, I will not get the Ipad 3 again.  People reading this, please post your comments if you are experiencing the same annoyance that I experienced.  It is truly a shame as the majority of people that buy this product want to use it to show off their amazing high rez photos on the beautiful Retina Display that the Ipad 3 has.Thoughts?	
243	2	3	3	3	4	0	4	4	1	1	4	4	I was hooked...!! I went to BB to tinker with the Galaxy Tab 2 and the Asus Prime. I was definitely going to order one of those. I had ABSOLUTELY no intention of even considering an iPad. I have always had Android in my phones and wasn't about to change now.As I played with these two tablets, I noticed the pros/cons as stated by reviewers. My complaint with the Galaxy was the bit of lag, especially in the browser... but it was doable. The Prime just flat out disappointed me with it's non-bright display. I thought that someone put the display settings down but it was on high. I tried another one thinking that maybe this was defective and I got the same dark(er) screen. Also had the same lag time. Was also scared about the wi-fi issues I had heard about. And wi-fi is the main reason I am purchasing a tablet.For the hell of it I looked at the iPad 3 since it was right next to these. I immediately saw a huge difference in resolution. The more I studied it the more I was blown away. I went back and forth comparing the text resolution to the other two and there is NO comparison. The text on the iPad 3 is just crystal clear and as sharp as can be. You can even see the difference between the iPad3 & iPad2. While looking at small text I had to zoom in a little to read it with the Androids but with the Ipad 3 I could leave it at it's smallest text and read it easily.Also there was NO lag at all in the browser. It flowed smoothly with no hiccups or lags. After seeing this I went back to the Galaxy and now I can realllly notice the lag. Scrolling through web pages it was choppy and hesitant (in comparison).When pinching the pages, it would jump a bit and go down a few lines. With the IPad 3, no jumping at all. Pinching was extremely smooth and perfect. I have been converted!!Yes, I would love to have the Android personilization, but better graphics and smoothness are more important to me. The other tablets just can't compare in this department. I am a convert.Note - Give careful consideration as to the storage size you need. I was going to get the 16GB model and although I do not do many games, I was concerned about running out of space. If the iPad allowed you to use an SD card, then the 16GB would have been my choice; but I stepped up to the 32GB model to play it safe. Currently I have only a few games and about 4 apps. I have NO photos or music on here yet and already I have taken up almost 4GB of space. Obviously pre-installed material contributed to this but I would recommend that you consider the size carefully. If you will be saving movies, music and large photos, it may be wised to consider the 32gb model.	
244	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	1	2	4	4	Excelent gift. I gave this as a college graduation gift and she loves it. I was also given one for work to review and work toward utilizing tablets in replacement of laptops where applicable. I was skeptical but have become a fan of the I Pad.	
245	2	3	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	4	3	3	Great, But Keep Out of Sun. I set out to purchase the Asus Transformer Prime, and ended up with the New iPad instead, because of the pretty screen.  I was able to compare them side by side at the store and wow!  I was instantly impressed by the iPad.  This is my first Apple product, and at first, I found myself constantly comparing it to the freedom to which I had become accustomed with Android. Once I got over my Apple frustration, I was able to resolve most issues by choosing applications that work on both iOS and Android, and so far, so good.  Everything just works.  For example, I was able to hit "print," and my documents printed on my HP wireless printer without any setup, downloading drivers, etc.  It just printed.  Very cool.  Today, however, I tried to use the iPad as a reader while sunbathing.  After 15 minutes, I received a "temperature warning," advising me to shut the iPad down until it cooled off.  I felt through the cover, and it was really hot.  I shut it down and placed it in the shade, and after 15 minutes, it was fine again. Lesson learned.  The iPad cannot tolerate direct sunlight.	
246	3	4	2	4	3	0	4	4	1	1	3	4	The new Ipad 3. I have had the new Ipad for almost 3 weeks now. I've downloaded lots of apps, use it for business meetings, play HD games on it, take pictures in different settings, use it to stream videos, watch my own videos on it, do some ppt presentations on it, use MSWord and Excell documents on it, read some iBooks on it, put the battery into constant abuse to see how long it last and I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty much impressed! But I do have a few cons about this tablet. And now I will list my pros and cons below.PROS & CONS:1.  Retina display is stunning! I have view wallpapers, photos, videos(my own uploaded & streaming)and it looks incredibly sharp and crisp.  I have some photos that were taken during a trip to SF Bay a few months back and forgot to bring my Cannon DSLR camera so we took some pictures with my wife's little samsung handheld 8mp camera.  When these photos loaded onto my laptop they look ugly, blurry, and pixelated but when I had them transfer to the new Ipad to view...wow they look great (not amazing, but great). The retina display help the photos to shine!  I've also uploaded the movie "The Lorax and Acts of Valor" to the new Ipad and even at 720p, the pictures looks stunning.  Then I stream movies from Netflix and Amazon and the pictures looks even more stunning.  Last week we went to a hiking trip and I took some pictures with the Ipad's camera.  I was a little skeptical due to the fact that it didn't have a built in flash, but when I view the pictures both on the new Ipad and my laptop, I was amazed how good the pictures look (it makes me wanted to take it to walmart and have it printed).  I even test the display laying down and try viewing from the side and the picture still looks stunning.  Overall, the Retina display on the new Ipad is topnotch and you will love it! Definately a PRO!2.  Performance wise, the Ipad is a quard core (4X) processor and with only 1g of internal graphics memory I don't really have much issues with it.  I have had a few crashes with some apps but I believe it's due to the app.  I have run apps that are processor hungry such as Air Supremacy and Garageband without a glitch.  I know with any tablet, you will experience some problems and the Ipad 3 is no exception.  I only wish apple put a 6 cores and 2g of memory inside but that would up the price too. Neither PRO or CON.3.  Responsiveness, the touch screen response pretty quick with my fingers but I'm using a stylus pen and depends on how hard the tip of your stylus pen is sometimes the screen won't register.  You will need to push a little harder. Still a PRO!4.  Productivity, with any tablet you buy it because you want it to use it for work and play, right?  Well, I have work with the new Ipad and play with it and this is how I feel.  I've used it to take notes during a meeting (I'm the notetaker) using just the app "Note" with a bluetooth keyboard and I was able to keep up with the meeting.  Pretty impressive! I have use it to give out speeches using ppt slideshow and able to use and edit MSWord on the tablet.  Even if I have to use third party apps to be able to use ppt and words, it runs great and very impressive!  I've used the tablet to remote controll my laptop and wow it runs smoothly without a glitch.  I was able to download some of the files I needed to my new Ipad within minutes!  You can access ONLive, Dropbox, etc. on the tablet without any issues.  Reading on the new Ipad is great also.  The letters on the screen is truly crisp, clear and sharp and I gotta say it's the best compare to any tablet on the market now (Even with the new Asus Infinety TF700).  PLAYTIME! Games, Games and Games!  I've downloaded tons of games, bowling, Angry birds, hockey, fruit ninja, pool, DH reloaded, Riptide, Dark Me, FLcommando, Dead Trigger, Juggernaut, GT HD, Air Supremacy, Metalstorm, F18 Carrier, Gunships, Blood and Glory, Infinety blade, and many more that I've played and deleted.  The games looks stunning on the new Ipad and it plays well (especially Air Supremacy, wow you gotta check out the graphics on that game!). THIS IS MOST DEFINATELY A PRO!5.  Well, every tablet has it goods and bads and it's no exception for Apple's new Ipad.  I have the screen brightness at "AUTO" and in my opinion I don't think the battery lasted long enough. It lasted about 6.5 to 7 hours for me.  This made me want to get the Asus Infinety TF700 with the keyboard dock.  I went to bestbuy to ask them why didn't the new Ipad support flash and they gave me a bunch of bullship excuses.  Well it's APPLE! They want to be different!  I really wish that my wallpapers could be a moving background like all the android tablets.  NO ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS - a bummer for me!  NO microSD card slots, HDMI, or anything else except your power button, wake, and volume buttons.  And it will cost me an arm and a leg to get accessories/adapters for the new Ipad to be able to stream (HDMI) movies to my HD TV, shoot my ppt presentation on a screen, transfer photos/videos to and from my new Ipad.  And most of all, I can not expand my internal storage cuz NO microSD card!  I bought (well...my wife bought it for me.  What a nice wife I have!) the 32g Ipad and with all the apps, movies, videos, photos I have already I'm down to 7g of memory left.  Darn! should have told her that I wanted the 64g!6.  Other CONS that I have are, IT GETS HOT! as hot as my 3 year old laptop.  The new Ipad can be a heater for winter (although the new Ipad might freeze during winter).  Do not put your Ipad in the car!  It does not like heat!  Even under the seat it will overheat, it likes to breath just like you and me.  It's like why would you lock your animal or kids in a warm summer car.  Same concepts here people! why would you lock your Ipad in a hot summer car.  When you play intense games or run application hungry apps it will get hot and you will notice it.  Another gripe, I mean CON.  What $#R@# is the use of a facing camera that takes pictures or video that looks like VHS quality.  All these tablet companies that have a little wimpy low resolution facing camera on their tablet need to go and do more research.  If you're willing to put a 8MP camera on the back might as well put one in the front.  I want to look stunning when I facetime with friends and family.  It's an advertisement gig! LOOK GOOD on camera to show the world they will come and buy your product!  PUT a decent camera on the front!7. And LAST but not LEAST!  I was very happy that the next system upgrade on the new Ipad, Apple will finally have SIRI on the new Ipad.  Well...at least I will have a woman to talk to when my wife is not home.  I just hope Apple don't use a man instead! better yet, give options to choose man or woman or an alien.  I guess, after all the PROS and CONS and gripes it all comes down to one last question.  DO I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THE NEW IPAD 3?  Yeah...yeah! If you have the cash ($499 and up) or if you have a beautiful and very nice wife that would buy one for you.  " GO AHEAD MAKE YOUR DAY! YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED! "

I purchased the iPad 3rd Generation when it was released and I stopped using my laptops to browse the web or watch videos.  I used it for school and work for taking notes, but I felt like writing on the screen was awkward.  For the most part, it was just for browsing the web and watching movies.Being a student, I really needed something lightweight and functional for school, but I was unable to program in it, or type quickly.  I just sold my iPad on eBay and purchased a MacBook Air instead and I am glad I did.  It's not too heavy and does so much more than an iPad could ever do.  The problem with the iPad is that its software is too restricting, and can't do everything a computer can do.  Don't expect it to replace your laptop if you need to use them for more than just movies and web browsing.	
248	4	1	0	4	4	4	2	4	2	2	3	4	My Apple iPad 32GB. This product meets all of the criteria I was looking for in a portable tablet, the features are easy to use for novice such as me-----I am not the britest star in the universe when it comes to technology however this Pad makes me shine!!LP--Memphis	
249	3	0	2	4	4	4	4	0	1	3	4	4	ipad. new ipad, fun and easy to work with, easier webbrowsing than kindle fire; good bargain. no regrets. number of primarily associated and recommended apps should be increased.	
250	3	4	1	4	3	1	4	4	4	1	4	4	Wonderful IF ONLY....... There were no instructions on how to  register all the different components.  I still cannot get into most of the apps.  Honestly, I am totally frusttrated with this device.  I know it can do so many things, yet, I cannot get to any of them.  So far I have been able to get emails (sometimes), take pictures, take videos, and send pictures.  Other than that,  it just sits and gathers dust.  NOT what I expected for $700.	
251	4	4	0	4	3	4	4	0	2	3	2	4	An okay product, but don't believe the hype. I have owned one of these since it first came out. I can see it's use for simply surfing the web and casual gaming, but not much else.Most people know about the iPad, so I'm not going to get into too many specifics, but I will say I simply didn't care of it. I bought it to help with music production, which it was heavily advertised for. It simply does not work that well with music production. I did enjoy the interface it has the Omnisphere, the best VST money can buy in my opinion, but beyond that, I didn't enjoy using it. I tried multiple apps, and for the most part have been greatly disappointed. I would rather use a windows based laptop/tablet or mac and be able to use many more of the products on the market.Don't believe the hype. It is not built for music production. It cannot hold a candle to a PC or a full Mac in that aspect. The guitar effects are never up to par, and it just doesn't have the power it needs to do so, certainly not for the price.	
252	4	4	3	2	3	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	Excellent product. I'm very satisfied with the item that I bought to you. Thanks for you services, I hope to bought again to you.	
253	2	2	4	4	4	3	0	0	3	0	4	4	None. I received the product on time and with All the characteristics included as the web pageThe service from the web was nice and was updates alway	
254	3	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	2	3	3	3	Instruction Manual Required. So many features and shortcuts still to discover. Siri can't cope with my "English" accent! Asides from that, very good.	
255	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	4	Best Gift. I bought this for my wife, and was the perfect girt for her, she used every single day, every time	
256	4	0	4	0	4	1	1	4	0	4	4	4	BRAND NEW. My IPad came right on time as expected and when the description said like brand new they might as well have put BRAND NEW there wasnt a scratch smudge or anything on it.. It was Perfect in everyword. It came in its original packaging and everything was in the box as stated Im completely in Love with my New IPad i cant stay off of it.. I will definently be looking for other products from you guys Thanks So Much , Erika M.	
257	4	4	3	4	4	3	2	1	4	2	4	4	Great Product. Trouble Free.  Use a couple of hours a day...news, entertainment, etc.  Great when on the road.  I may buy another.	
258	3	4	3	4	4	3	1	4	0	1	4	4	Good stuff! Yes, I'm loving it! Especially the retina display that we can't see the pixels itself. I'm using it as a mixing table the most and once, I was in a very, very hot place, under the sun and I saw a warning "cool-up your ipad" or something like that, and I have to quick cool it up and everything was fine after.	
259	4	3	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	4	4	Super! The iPad is already a legend. It can support so many great apps, great battery life, and superior, intelligent design. Love it!	
260	0	4	2	4	0	4	1	2	4	1	3	4	Cord needed. Needed a new power cord as the cord was not the APPLE cord which should have come with it, but it was no problem purchasing a new one.	
261	4	3	2	4	0	4	4	0	4	4	3	3	I Love It But...... I think this was my fault but my only complaints are shortcomings I never considered when I bought my iPad. I never realized this "model" iPad would be incapable of using anything but wi-fi. I was under the impression, like the iPhones, there would be an option to get a broadband plan for those times when wi-fi isn't available. Unfortunately, I didn't learn this until a few weeks later. My other issue is that the iPad cannot text or IM to any non-Apple device. You can email, just not text. With this issue however, there are apps you can get which will allow for texting to other devices. They aren't quite as simple to use(just a few more steps) but I'm sure that is by design. So do your research better than I did, especially if you want to take your iPad with you and need the option of buying a plan for it.	
262	0	4	4	4	4	1	0	2	4	2	0	4	Best buy has it for 314.00 brand new. They removed my comment earlier for informing the public so just got to best buy and you will get a better deal.	
263	0	1	4	2	0	4	4	3	4	2	0	0	advertised as new. This was advertised as a new product and arrived sealed - even with the tear off film on the screen.  However, upon opening found another persons email address, personal contacts, pictures, etc.  I had to go to the trouble of finding someone to help me default all of this as if direct from the manufacuturer.  When paying this much for an item I expect it to be as advertised.  Beware of this seller!!  I gave 1 star because I do hate being lied to!!	
264	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	2	3	4	Great Tablet. Dont need to review.. its proven to be a great product., One thing is the flash player which limits your ability to view online videos or online music..	
265	3	4	2	0	4	1	4	4	4	1	0	0	I received a model with a Refurbished Serial Number and Model Number. I bought the MC705LL/A through Amazon from a marketplace seller, fulfillment by Amazon.  The box that came was the box for a new iPad, but the label under the cellophane on the bottom of the box had serial and model numbers for a refurbished iPad.  The description on the label was "FC705LL/A RFB IPAD WI-FI 16GB BLACK-USA".  Note the "RFB" in the description and the model number starts with F.  The serial number started with DK.  Three signs of it being a refurbished unit.Outside the cellophane on the top of the box was a sticker that had all the information to label it as new, including the word "New" in bold type...I contacted Amazon for a refund.  That went smoothly.  The seller's attitude was that it should have been a new iPad. He said he never sees the boxes of items fulfilled by Amazon; something like his products go straight through Amazon warehouses.  He did point out that refurbished iPads have different boxes with "Certified Refurbished"  printed on the front.  My box was not one of those.After I researched Apple Certified Refurbished, I concluded that a certified refurbished iPad is ok, but I PAID for a new one.  I ended up buying an Apple Certified Rerurbished iPad 3rd Gen at a price point that was in line with it being a refurbished unit.I don't know if this problem was the seller's fault or the fault of the "system."  3rd Generation iPads are no longer in production.  The only models being produced as NEW are: iPad With Retina Display (4th Gen); iPad Mini; and 2nd Generation iPads.  I suspect that any entity selling a 3rd Generation iPad listed as "new" is selling second-hand goods.  It seems to me that Amazon needs to update their product page for the 3rd Gen iPad to reflect this information.	
266	3	4	2	4	3	1	0	1	4	1	4	4	He loves it... My husb bought this for work and he loves it. I love this one more than my ipad 2 because it has speak to type option so emailing is MUCH easier. He does not use that option...ever which is a waste if you ask me but he is more old fashioned in that sense.	
267	3	3	4	3	3	4	4	4	0	0	4	3	Good. I think it's a good deal, bought it and used it with no major problem. you deserve 5 stars for it	
268	3	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	2	0	4	4	Fantastic! I love my iPad.  The display is amazing for my pictures.  Prompt service and everything works as expected.  Thank you!

PROSWell BuiltNice DisplayGood Touch screenCONSNO USB portEven at 64GB you don't have enough memory to do muchFront facing camera sucksRear facing camera is marginalNo zoom or flash on rear facing cameraNeeds aftermarket keyboard if you wish to type anything longer than a sentence or twoCharger get's VERY hot when you chargePOWER HOG - don't expect more than a few hours of video playback no matter what other people claim. And if you are using GPS and DATA streaming forget it, this thing sucks down the battery like crazy.Battery indicator lies - when it gets to 100% you are really at about 90%, keep charging for at least another 1-2 hours to get a full charge.Bottom LineIt's basically a hopped up smart phone with a bigger screen. Fun for face time, basic emails, watching YouTube videos or to play games but in reality it doesn't have enough computing power, memory or a functional keyboard to be useful as a mini-computer.EDIT: After Apple released the new IOS and it's subsequent update I have lowered my rating. NOT because the new IOS is bad but because of the stupid way it updates. Before you would update the IOS and the IOS only, now you have to completely wipe the IPAD's memory even for the littlest update (last one they added a Greek keyboard). That means you lose EVERYTHING on your IPad and you have to download it ALL again. That's right, every song, picture, app, data, video, magazine, kindle book, etc. etc. etc. But not before you have to input you Wi-Fi password (for every Wi-Fi account you use) and your apple account and password, not once but three times in order to even start using your IPad. For me to reprogram all of the passwords, restore all of the apps and re-download all of the data takes about 8 hours on a pretty high-speed connection of clicking on apps. This is CRAZY and for that reason alone it loses another star.Sorry apple the more I use your products the more infuriating they become.

272	3	4	1	3	3	3	4	4	2	4	3	3	Very nice used product. Very good shape, works great and connects wifi very easily and quickly. This item does however charge very slowly weather it's plugged into USB or wall charger. I don't know if that is the nature of this beast or not as my son'd is the next gen up from this and his charges rather quickly. Overall, very good product, very good packaging and very good seller.

Be very wary of purchasing any tech products from TechGiant.Purchased a 3rd gen ipad from them via Amazon and 8 months later the speaker stopped working.  Contacted Apple with the ipad's serial number and they said it did not exist or was never registered.  Ask TechGiant for assistance and they said they do not offer any warranty over the standard 30 days via Amazon.I asked TechGiant about the 1-year warranty on hardware that comes with all Apple products and TechGiant said that they cannot honor that as they do not know how long the devices have been sitting on their own shelf.  They said that if they bought the ipad from their distributor 6 months before a customer buys it on Amazon from them, there would only be 6 months left on the Apple warranty.This is absolutely not stated on the product page and we were VERY DISAPPOINTED with TechGiant!!!BUYER BEWARE of TechGiant!!!  Ask the how long the "new" device has been sitting on their "shelf" before they sell it to you.  I would never deal with this seller again.  You are better off buying directly from the Apple store.	
275	4	4	3	4	4	2	2	3	0	4	3	3	Met most expectations. It works just like any I Pad. I have no complaints. It came with passwords on it that we had a bit of a problem  However, when the sellar was notified. It took care of the problem immediately. I would recommend this sellar to others. I was a bit disappointed that the password were not removed prior to shipping that is why I rated the sellar at a 4 rather than a five.	
276	3	2	0	4	3	4	2	4	0	4	1	4	Apple iPad MD370LL/A (32GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, White) 3rd Generation. first of all, I ordered this item and the company sent the wrong product. The IPad they originally sent was in very good condition. But I had to send that one back to get what I ordered. It was not in good condition. all four sides were dented on the ends. that info was not relayed in the description. These companys should be upfront about all details and show pictures. Don't think I will ever buy anything from them again.	
277	3	2	2	4	3	0	4	4	2	4	4	4	The ipad has replaced my laptop beautifully. It's all I was looking for period. I particularly enjoyed taking pictures and enjoyed using it's GPS for driving and finding places.The ipad has become one of the wonder products of this century, many thanks to Apple Corp.	
278	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	it looks as new. It seems to have been used properly.it works well.the preowner seems to be a good seller to take in consideration for your records

Within 3 weeks of moderate use (and handling with carefulness) the screen cracked and shattered at the top where you turn on and off.  This was not dropped or abused in any way.  Thankfully Amazon stood behind this purchase.  Again, this cracked with out dropage or any misuse.  I don't believe this was at the fault in any way of the shipper, but after further research appears to be an Apple issue.	
280	4	4	3	2	1	2	4	4	2	0	4	4	My Christmas present to me :) I liked the iPad for the price,storage and the ability to use 4gI don't see a lot of difference in the 3rd generation verses the new air so I feel I have really saved a lot of money very happy!	
281	4	4	0	4	1	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	Finally, my own portable "computer" I don't want or need a smart phone, but this does the trick for me. If I want what it offers, all I do is open the case; if I don't,, I just leave it closed. Unlike the phone, it is only available on my terms.	
282	3	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	3	3	My new Ipad. I have only been using on wifi, so I can only review the item itself as wonderful, I love it.  I'm hoping that once I subscribe to Verizon I can give it a 5 star.	
283	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	4	3	4	4	4	Great product at a great price. Exactly what we expected. Pleased with our purchase! We're so glad we checked for refurbished rather than new. It does everything we need.	
284	4	4	3	2	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	GREAT. My daughter loves the ipad, it works great and looked like new, it was in good shape.  Thank you  (:	
285	3	4	3	3	4	4	2	4	4	2	3	4	Good, Great, Wonderful ! I love it. I love my iPad.  Smaller than a laptop and bigger than an iPod touch.  I've taken tons of good pictures with it too.	
286	4	4	2	3	4	1	4	4	2	4	3	3	It is a good ipad. I bought it to my friend and my friend likes it. It's useful, but a big problem is that it doesn't support extra storage

288	4	1	4	4	4	0	3	4	4	4	4	4	Fantastic! I was worried about this device not being fast enough considering the newer model is around double the processing speed according to benchmarks.  Everything I have used this model for has not had even the slightest hick-up or delay, including artwork using the jot 4 touch pressure stylus (procreate).Overall I still prefer android for phones, (used both plenty) but as far as tablets go Apple's iPad takes the cake.  You won't find things like Emulators (legal reasons) though, and now that they have Google Now (Siri feels more like a gimmick a lot of the time when I try to find information) there's not a whole lot of reason to choose android other than price.Also, the battery life on this thing is amazing.  It's rated for around 10 hours, but for me I can sometimes go almost a week before needing to charge it.	
289	3	4	4	3	4	0	4	1	2	3	4	4	The best 9.7 inch tablet I have ever used! What's included?The device is packaged nicely and the box includes the iPad charger rated at 2.1 Amps at 5.1 VDC. It also includes a USB to iPad cable for use with the power supply and it also interfaces with your computer to connect to iTunes. The cable is only 41 inches long which is always one of my pet peeves because when you plug the charger in the wall the cable is too short to allow you to reach to the top of a dresser for example and charge the product at night. The first thing you will do is buy a USB male to female extender cable or buy the Apple extended version charger at $29 cost to charge the unit properly.You also get a one page instruction card that basically says to turn on the unit and follow the directions. You also get the important product information guide and two white apple logos to use as you desire.Set up* Turn it on and select your language and touch next.* Select your country and touch next.* It will ask you if you want to have the unit identify the location of where you are at. Select yes as this is important for later tracking of the device if it is stolen.* Activate networks, which in my case was only WIFI. Select your SSID from the list of possible connections, enter in your password, if your network is protected. Touch next.* Activate your Apple ID using your e-mail address and your Apple password.* Accept the Apple terms.* It will then start a set up.* It asks if you want to use the cloud option for communication and uploading and downloading.* It asks if you want to use the dictation mode when you touch the microphone on the keyboard.* The iPad then does some diagnostics and loading.* It asks you if you are ready to register the product with Apple.* It then tells you that you are ready to use the iPad.Attach the unit to your computer that has iTunes installed, (make sure you are using the latest version):* When you plug in the iPad it asks if you want to set it up as a new iPad or to use the data of an existing iPad. I selected New iPad.* It asks you to select an iPad name. Make sure that it is unique so that you don't confuse iTunes into thinking you have two devices with the same name.* The iPad is set to auto sync and I stopped that as my music files are to large for the 64 GIG memory. I select only the music, videos, and photos I want to sync.* The unit will begin to sync your data and it will install all of your existing apps you own as long as you have not exceeded the limit of 5 Apple devices using those apps.* Your apps are all loaded as single apps and if you want you have to combine them into folders and name the folders. This took me about an hour as we own over 200 apps. The list was 10 pages long.* I then told the iPad to sync with my contacts, calendar and with two email accounts using Outlook. Don't forget you will have to enter in your ISP email account password for each email account you sync with before your e-mail will be down loaded.* All of these steps occurred without error and they happened very quickly. This unit is faster than the iPad 2 device and it clearly shows while processing these steps.Installing Kindle Reader app.* I use the Kindle reader app a lot and it was already installed above by the app installation process.* Touch the Kindle app and it will ask you for your Amazon ID and password. Almost instantly it tells you that you can look at your books in the Cloud and you will start to load up the book covers. Each cover will have a downward pointing arrow on it to indicate that it has not been downloaded to your device.* Touch each cover and the book will download. I have a very good WIFI and each book only took seconds. I own about 350 Kindle books and the process was very fast. You can touch 10 to 15 books and it will download them sequentially and very quickly.* When you are reading a book and want to look up a word in the dictionary, the first time it will ask you if you want to download the dictionary to your device. Select yes and it takes about 5 seconds to do this. Look up of words is virtually instantaneous.* You will notice the outstanding quality of the display as the text looks like a printed page with perfect resolution and dark text. It is impressive!Find iPhone* Touch the Find iPhone icon* Enter in your Apple ID and Password and touch Go.* The application will then locate all of your Apple devices assigned to your account. You can now look at each location either on a map or even a satellite view. If your iPad does not show up then go to settings and touch Location Services and turn on Find My iPad and Status Bar Icon. You will be able to locate your device within about 10 to 20 feet!* It is critical that you set this up as you can now track your device if it is lost or stolen!* You can also make the missing device, Play a Sound, Remote Lock, Remote Wipe, and even allow it to send you an e-mail when the device is found.SecurityThis is one of Apple's shining stars regarding security. By touching settings for example you can set Auto-Lock to on, select a Passcode Lock and set restrictions. By doing this you can lock your iPad with a simple or more complex passcode (recommended) so that if it is stolen you will not lose your data to a hacker. Under restrictions the list is 21 items long. You can give this device to a child and turn off the web browsing, social networks, buying games and products, dictation, installing and deleting apps, etc...This product is professionally designed and if you are giving this to a child (or even giving them an iPod) you can lock these features and feel secure that they have access to only the things you want them to have. You can even assign age limits for music, shows, movies, apps, etc.. It is the best security setup available today.Web browsingUnbelievably fast! This is where the strength of the new processor shows and the speed of the WIFI connection is wonderful. It is virtually as fast as my 1GHz wired Ethernet connected computer. The streaming of video is fast and flawless.Face TimeThe advantage of having a front and rear facing camera is that you can call anyone using a iPhone 4 or iPad 2 or the new iPad and talk to them and see them simultaneously if they are connected to a good WIFI connection. The new cameras on this iPad are 5 Mega pixels and you will see the difference immediately. The video and picture are extremely clear.Face Time is very nice and if you want you can even swap camera front to back so instead of the person you called seeing you they can see what you are seeing. This is a very nice and powerful feature.TypingTyping is smooth and fast. You cannot type with two thumbs (as the screen is too wide) and it is better to rotate the device to landscape mode and get a good sized keyboard to type on. I can almost type as fast on the iPad as I can on a full size computer keyboard.E-mailThis set up immediately and downloaded 50 e-mails into each account in about a minute. The e-mail system is easy to use and to respond on. It set up two email accounts for me in about 1 minute to set up and 1 minute to download the 50 e-mails.AppsApple has the best app store in the market. Amazon is getting better but Apple has a head start. Literally, "There is an app for that!" is not a joke but a reality. All of my 200 apps loaded via iTunes in about 20 minutes and we have a lot of them.CameraThe new 5 Megapixel camera is very nice. The quality is instantly recognizable in every photo and video you take. You actually record video in 1080P HD quality and between the camera and the display you will be amazed at how good the result is.There is no flash on the camera so that is an issue in low lighting.One of the advantages of the iPad is the number of high quality apps that can be used to tweak your photographs and make them look professional. We own several of these apps and the results can be spectacular. You can literally make a professional looking photography show using these apps and with this improved camera the results will even be better.Dictation and microphoneUsing the iPad Notes function you can touch the microphone on the keyboard and dictate to the iPad. I dictated this paragraph and it translated it to text with fewer typing errors than I did while typing this section. After you finish dictation, just retouch the microphone on the keypad and the voice recording will be converted to text.FacebookSet up of Facebook was fast and easy. Just enter your e-mail address and then your Facebook Password and you are on line. The quality of the pictures looks much better on the display as long as the person who set them up used a high quality photo.iTunes music and moviesI have input every CD and audio book I own into iTunes. I also have loaded MP4 movies into iTunes and they can be played on the iPad with very good results. They literally are HD quality. I purchased a 64 GIG version white iPad 3 to have the space to load as much music, photos, and videos as I can onto the device and use it for an entertainment center. I loaded 200 apps at 9.5 GIG and 350 Kindle books and I still have almost 48 GIG of free memory left for my other items!GamingI won't spend a lot of time here but just to say that we all know that the Apple products have some of the best gaming apps available. They vary from action games, sports games, strategy games, puzzle games and tower defense style games. Make sure that you buy the HD version of the games for the iPad in order to take advantage of the new display features.DisplayThe 9.7 Retina Display; 2048 x 1536 resolution produces razor sharp pictures and text. You simply have to see it to believe it. This screen has 3.1 million Pixels and is powered by a quad core graphics chip. The first three things I noticed were the quality of the pictures and videos and the text is crisper and darker.BatteryThis design has up to 10 hours of battery life even with all of these features. This makes the Apple iPad a truly enjoyable device when you know that you can listen to music, read, watch videos and work on photos for 10 hours and not have to worry about recharging or being tied to a power cable.Cons* No flash on the camera.* No 7" tablet available for a lower price and portability.* Power and connection cable 41" long, way too short in my opinion.* High price, demanded by the quality but still a gulp when you buy one!

If you have any questions or requests for clarifications you can leave a comment, and I'll be emailed, or you can email me directly by clicking on my name and looking for the link.I mostly use an iPad 1, but I have the opportunity to use an iPad 2 often.A lot has changed since the iPad came out, and I wrote my original review (located here:Apple iPad (first generation) MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi) titled with a quote from Woz, saying "Everyone wants things to be simpler, and along comes this simple thing" and its still very true.  Tablets aren't like PCs, you don't need to maintain them or worry about software requirements at all.  Its wonderful for people who hate that.  My friend can tell you exactly what processor his last laptop had, but what processor does his iPad have?  He'll say "Don't know, don't care".  If you are wondering why to get a tablet at all, I would recommend that you read that review. Its the second review on that page.So I bought the new iPad, the 2.5, or whatever you want to call it.  I'm not going to go into the tech specs, because, they are posted everywhere and unless you are a geek you will also fall into the "don't know/don't care" category.  I'm going to try to focus on just telling you what I would want to know before I bought it.  This review will be about real use.I chose a 32GB version.  Why?1) The new apps that will support the retina display are supposed to take more memory, so you should expect that whatever you had on your older iPad will take more space on this new one.2) I feel that the days of 16GB being enough may soon be passing.  With my 16GB iPad I was actually having to start managing my memory.  I had to start leaving things off it.3) The more powerful the iPad becomes, the more I expect to use it.  And this means, more memory will be needed.  The iPad has never been my primary "computer", but with this iteration it might be there:  I can plug an HD screen into it via HDMI now, and use a nice bluetooth keyboard.  However, you have to use the iPad itself as a gigantic touchpad, as you can't use a pointing device.  It mirrors whats on the screen, so, its clumsy-but-possible.  Still, we are getting so close to throwing the ipad down on the desk at work and just... working.So for the first time I plunked down my hard earned money for the 32GB version.  I think the 16GB version will be like having a 4GB iPhone 2G.I'd also like to point out that despite the improvements and upgrades, Apple is maintaining the same starting price that it did for the iPad 1 and the iPad 2.  This is very nice.The main new things -for me- in order of importance are:1)  The 4G LTE network (I have the AT&T; version).  We'll skip the cell phone enthusiast argument over whether this is really a 4G device, because 4G was actually supposed to be (clears throat) even better.  Because in spite of that, the 4G LTE may be the primary reason I plunked down my change and bought it.  I want to be able to do my work remotely without problems.I ran some tests on the new iPad.--In my office, which has a 6mbps DSL and wifi, I saw a 3.6Mbps upload and a  512k upload.  You might say "who cares?"  Ah but wait.--I signed up for the 3GB Data Plan at $30/mo, and when using the 4g LTE network, I saw a 17Mbps connection.--And at home, where we have the fiber optic connection, I only saw an 11Mbps connection.--And finally, my iPhone 4s got a lousy 2.5Mbps on the AT&T; 4G non-LTE network.So there you have the relative speeds.  All calculated using the Speed Test app.So here's the point... the new 4G service is a major upgrade.  On the LTE network it is very fast - however, I did experience some latency when just checking emails traveling in a car driving 70 mph.  This is typical for this technology, it seems to have problem switching from tower to tower.  But if you are sitting at a park downtown then I don't think you'll see those problems.  What does this mean?  You should see a movie download in 1/2 to 1/4 of the time. And the iPad will be able to act as a wifi hub for all your devices.  In other words, I will be able to use the iPad for internet for my laptop too.  Now, at the time of this writing, it should be noted that you cannot use your iPad as a wifi hotspot with AT&T.;  At this time only Verizon supports that feature.  (Maybe you want to pick the Verizon version if this is important to you).Now, I live in a metro area in one of the biggest cities in the USA, so, your 4g service may vary.  And they are charging a super premium price:  $10 per GB.  A full length movie on iTunes is 2GB or 3GB, so it can't replace my home connection, but its great for work and casual use.Back to the countdown:2) The "resolutionary" screen.  It is true that this screen is amazing and a pleasure to look at.  You can't see the pixels, and I love that.  I love that on my iPhone 4 too.  It will take a while for the App makers to really utilize this to its full extent, so I don't think you need to got all excited and upgrade tomorrow.3) The faster processor.  I actually did not have a problem with my old iPad processor, but soon my old iPad will be like using a 2G iPhone.  But it will take a while for the App makers to really utilize this to its full extent.  Once again, I don't think you need to upgrade tomorrow, but, a few months after release it should be a lock (I happen to know that many iPad developers wait until they can actually get their hands on a retail unit before upgrading their existing apps, although once they get the retail unit its like a race to finish).4) Dictation.  I have used this with success.  However, like most voice recognition software its usefulness is reduced by the fact that I'm seldom in a quiet place. Still, I like it.  I think its a valuable addition, and I typically use it when I only would have to type a few words.  I don't use it to type long letters, as its not completely accurate and I think editing out all the mistakes would take longer than typing it out.  (I do use an Apple brand bluetooth keyboard for serious typing: Apple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B [NEWEST VERSION] I have also tried a chicklet style one but it didn't work well for me: Kensington iPad 2 Case with Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for Apple iPad 2 3G Tablet, WIFI Model K39521US.5) The camera.  I don't think I'll use this much.  Mostly when taking pictures of things that I'm writing about, which isn't that often.  Maybe for some FaceTime.  But I don't think this makes it worth it to upgrade from the Original Ipad.  (the iPad 2 had a camera, so you can ignore this if you have an iPad 2)Other usage changes since iPad 1:1) I bought an HP envy (HP Envy 110 e-All-in-One Printer for the wireless printing from iPad and iPhone.  This has worked out VERY well.  I think the AirPrint implementation has worked nicely.2) One thing I was disappointed with the original iPad for was the inability to see what was on the iPad screen on a TV.  Since then I have purchased an Apple TV Apple TV MC572LL/A (2010) [OLD VERSION] which is now the old version.  And Apple has made it possible to see whatever is on the screen of the iPad on a bigger screen, and you can buy HDMI adapters now: Apple Digital AV Adapter (MC953ZM/A)3) On my first review I talked about the ability to put your iPhone sim card into your iPad and share your existing data service.  I tried this out, putting my iPhone microsim in the new iPad and I was invited to purchase a new data plan.  So apparently that little moneysaver has been eliminated.Other things that stay the same:You still won't be able to use Flash, a website programming language that allows websites to act more like computer programs.  I've read that the reason that Apple won't allow this is that Flash is often the gateway to getting viruses and other nasties.  As a result, there is no need to have antivirus software on your iPad, its very very safe.  The iPad is rock solid reliable.  In fact, the only virus I've heard of for the iPad is where someone had to send you a Pdf via email and get you to open it.  And of course, thats threat was removed before I even heard about it.On my last review, I talked about usage.  Apps I use a lot now:1) Logmein: to do anything on my computer that I can't do on an iPad.  This would include Flash based software.  I connect to a computer THROUGH my iPad, and control the computer to go to flash sites.  Ordinarily I would say this is not worth it, but the computer also runs engineering programs and other programs that don't really exist for the iPad.2) Gopayment to accept credit cards, although Quickbooks Online usage is hampered by the fact that Quickbooks makes you use a stripped down version through the safari web browser.  Once again, use LogMein Ignition.3) I find the spreadsheet program (numbers) to be highly annoying.  However, there was recently an announcement that MS Office programs Excel Word and Powerpoint will soon be available for the iPad with an interface similar to MS OneNote.  I'll be buying a copy of Excel and hoping that it doesn't suck.4) Find my Friends: I see where people are without having to call them and say "where are you?" which is nice.  Because I can see where my wife is without calling her, I get less honeydos.  Wipe that smirk off your face >:(  But also if you know they are driving you don't have to worry about distracted driving causing an accident.5) I don't end up playing many games on the iPad.  I play a lot of games on the iPhone.  But thats just my usage experience.  Maybe that will change with the new screen.You can read my original iPad review (linked above) for more usage ideas, if you are new to tablets.A bit more about usage, someone pointed out in a comment that you don't need the HDMI adapter if you intend to use AirPlay.  Airplay includes the ability to wirelessly stream audio and video from your iPad to a TV.  Typically this is only from apps that share music and movies, which is the functionality of Airplay (You PLAY things over the air).  There are Airplay adapters, including the AppleTV.  However, the HDMI connector does more than the Airplay allows: You can share the actual screen of your iPad, no matter what it shows, to a TV as a mirror image.  If you were to want to use the iPad as your primary "computer", you would probably want an HDMI adapter for big screen use.  I meet more people each month who do use a Tablet as their primary computer, so I felt this was an important point to clarify.  I own the AppleTV and the HDMI adapter, and use them in different ways at different times.Will this Ipad 2.5 make my original iPad as useless as a 4GB iPhone 2G?  For the first 6 months, no.  But after that, its likely.  Overall I am happy I bought it, mostly for the native 4G LTE internet.  Followed by the beautiful screen.  The faster processor is the 3rd reason, and as soon as the app developers start utilizing it to greater advantage, it will likely become the #1 reason.  And I think I'll feel that that has happened in about 6 months.After MS Excel comes out I may make an attempt to make the iPad my primary computing device, using the HDMI out and a bluetooth keyboard.  Wish me luck.	
291	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	3	2	4	4	Amazing Retina Display. I had the original iPad for a couple of months back in 2010 and really liked to browse the web on it. When I heard the new one is coming out, I preordered the white ATT 64GB from Apple website. I received it on the launch day two weeks ago, and I am really enjoying the new Retina display ever since. It is such an improvement over the first iPad, and I really enjoy reading different things on it.Color Choice:My original iPad was black, but this time against all the online suggestions, I went for the white version. My reasoning was, if you really want to read something--either web or text--having black borders only makes your eyes hurt even more. Printed books do not have black borders, and yet they are the easiest to read. I am happy to report that my intuition was right, and the white version is easier on my eyes for reading purposes. Maybe it is not the best for playing video games or watching movies, but the white border actually helps the reading. In addition, it is not completely white and has a beautiful pinkish hue that looks like pearl from some angles.Connectivity and Speed:I could connect to both of my router 2 GHz and 5 GHz channels via Wi-Fi. Out of curiosity, I inserted my modified T-Mobile SIM card into the GSM spot, and it did pick T-Mobile internet but worked only on 2G (Edge) mode. It works very well with Apple TV 3, and I was able to duplicate the iPad screen with my 40" LCD. However, the screen aspect ratio was only 4/3 and not 16/9.This new iPad is much faster than my original iPad. I can even browse the web much faster on this version let alone other programs and games. I ordered the Camera Connection Kit alongside this iPad, and it can import and read my 24MP pictures from Sony A77 without any problems.Cameras:My original iPad didn't have any camera, so it is so much fun to use FaceTime and the back camera. Both of them are quality cameras, although I don't see much use of the backside camera. I have my iPhone for that application. Maybe if you want to shoot movies and edit on the iPad itself, it is worth to have a good quality rear camera.Problems:I use international keyboards sometimes to enter foreign characters into the search, and I encountered several crashes when changing keyboard in Safari. One time I was writing a paragraph in Notes app, and suddenly the app crashed because I accidentally clicked on international icon. The problem was, I lost all the text I typed. I think the new iOS needs some minor bug fixes.Verdict:It is the best tablet I've ever used. It is fast and responsive, light, and it has an excellent LCD which is easy on your eyes. Does it worth the price? It depends. Like any other Apple products, this is made from high quality materials, and it is stylish. Paying the price is hard, but once you start using it, all the fun begins. Hope you could find valuable information in my mini review.

293	3	4	4	4	0	0	2	3	1	4	3	3	It all depends on how you'll be using this device. From an Android based perspective, this device will get a 4-star if not 3-star for many reasons.  While loyal Apple fans or people who want to use the basic apps but appreciate its design you'll likely give it a 5-star.  So I had to go with the 4-star to be fair.Where the iPad 3 shines:- Gorgeous screen; not much complaint here as watching HD movies including Netflix and YouTube video is amazing- Thin & lightweight; for its size, it's not too big of a hassle to carry around- Beautiful design overall; Apple pretty much set a standard for today's tablets and they still keep simplicity in a beautiful design- Simple; you don't need to know how to use Apple products, great for kids and adults that aren't exactly tech savvy- Amazing battery life; I could play Minecraft for hours and don't eat up batteries like other tablets do- Very responsive; for the most part depending on the app.  Rarely freezes (yes, it still does freeze from time to time) and is fast enough to run any HD games and apps.Where iPad 3 doesn't impress:- No flash.  Flash enabled sites either need a flash compatible browser if not you cannot view the content.- No GPS for the Wifi version; this would annoy you if you're looking to use it for navigation (you'll need separate GPS module made by another company that cost at least $100)- Slow charging; with the wall charger it comes, it does charge very slow.  The only negative side of the longer lasting tablet- Keyboard is not intuitive; difficult to type in landscape mode, no swype or other after-market keyboard like Android has- Expensive; for the money you'd think you'll get more out of the unit- Screen size icons; for the massive screen, you don't have a way to cram more icons forcing you to either create folders within or use multiple screens.- Many apps that are free on Android market often times are not free on Apple Stores.- Proprietary plugs; when will Apple learn?  No HDMI, mini-USB, etc.I personally recommend the iPad Wifi version for:- General entertainment for games, movies and news reading + where Wifi is available- Children; easy to navigate and use- Don't care about GPS navigation or use it for related purpose- Are not tech savvy or don't mind not having flash options- Want something simple and reliable- Want long battery lifeI don't recommend the iPad Wifi version if you:- Want to use this in the car, boat or wherever you need a GPS for navigation and plotting- Want to do any sort of modification including custom ROM's- Need flexibility in terms of the O/S- Are looking for cost savings and best bang for your moneyPersonally I'm more of an Android guy than Apple guy but it doesn't mean Apple's products are bad either.  It's one beautiful tablet I've ever played around with (it's my wife's) and aside from it not having GPS and other features available on Android, it's a solid performer.On a personal note, if they come out with a 7" tablet I wouldn't mind owning one.  Especially if it had GPS even on the Wifi version I'd buy one in a heartbeat.  To me, the pro's outweigh the con's for the iPad 3.  For as long as I can remember I've been a PC-guy where I didn't care for Apple but ever since iPod's came out, they've really changed the computer industry.You won't regret your purchase either way.  Just take note of what's not on the device and what to expect.	
294	3	3	0	4	4	4	3	4	0	0	0	0	Forced to drink Apple Koolaid. I could not believe that Apple was censored and shut down until i received my ipad as was forced to join the apple club to do anything.  you could not use the system at all without being forced to give apple personal information.  just like something out of an Orwell novel.  i will do android stuff from now on where i am not pushed into things against my will.	
295	4	3	3	4	4	2	1	3	1	4	4	4	The best in tablets, still the best! I am writing a review as a very enthusiastic Android tablet convert.  While I still love some Android tablets, thanks to now owning an iPad 3 after owning the Ipad 2 for a few months before that I can say that Android developers have to catch up BIG-TIME!  The design aesthetic and ease of use of the iOS system and the design philosophy that gets passed onto the developers who make the apps is beyond average.  I will give my impressions on a few different aspects that come to mind as far as superiority.Hardware----The aluminum unibody frame and simple design of the front just gives off a great feel of quality and even though its Chinese made it gives you an idea of what is possible for Chinese companies.  If Chinese workers can put together these high quality products, its only a matter of time before before they improve their design abilities and crack out well designed and quality over engineered products that will leave Western companies in the dust (Please remember my kind comments future Chinese overlords!)  Even the glowing green light for the FaceTime camera is a demonstration of superiority keeping in mind the amount of thought, time, and expense put into figuring out how to make it semi-transparent.  Google the article about the special machinery Apple custom designed and built just to accomplish that one simple task to make the light glow green through the material!  Its weight is very light considering the size of the battery and the retina screen.  The thinness is still pretty damned good considering all of the above features that are included.  Thanks to the uniformity of the device that they purposely kept, there are stupid amounts of available accessories that will hold, protect, or customize your hardware.  Genius!Software-----Web Browsing:Safari is one of the best mobile browsing experiences out there.  Thanks to HTML 5 I do not miss flash all that much since a lot of the video sites I thought I would be missing out on actually work pretty good.  I am able to use the browser to accomplish most tasks that there isnt an app for, or if the apps is crappy I can always pull up Safari and just act as if im on my MacBook Air.  Copy and post is really simple in the app also so that comes in handy a lot.Taking Notes:Thanks to tons of apps including Notability (which I highly recommend for all college students) that made me lugging around my backpack ALMOST irrelevant.  At the very least I could leave my laptop at home if I chose to and annotate slides from classes.Face Time:This program works great on the tablet.  I am able to have a conversation as close as possible to having the person in the room with me.  I've tried Tango, Skype, and Google Video Chat.  I just wish more people I knew had Face Time devices because I swear I would just stop making phone calls and just video conference with everyone.  Welcome overshare and having conversations in my boxers!Watching Videos:This is so convenient using ___ that I rarely use my laptop which has a bigger screen to watch videos that I have downloaded from the web including MKV files, AVI files, and mp4 files.  It has turned into my home entertainment center, car infotainment system, and my constant companion when I'm dying to watch my show and have to head to work.Calendar:Calendar works great with my Google Calendars and I can move events around and put in all kinds of related information.  Just works great, despite the fact that it relies on a Google calendar system in my case.Mail:Works great also.  Emails look good and I can easily copy and paste different parts of emails and pictures.Bottom Line:I started to write the bottom line simply because of the fact that I realized how easily I could go on and on about the different aspects of the device and speak glowingly about this tablet.  The point that should be taken from this, if you are reading this review and "considering" getting the new iPad just STOP and buy it.  I can guarantee that 99% of the population can come to love this device just as I have being a former Windows and Android fiend.  If I made the switch and feel this strongly about it, damn near anyone can be convinced that Apple does, not good but EXCELLENT products and software.  Just buy the damn thing, you wont look back!

For spending $600 on it, it should work flawlessly. Really disappointing. Now I have to hassle with taking it to a service center.

The package was slightly damaged. I wanted to buy the protection plan from Apple and so I contacted them. Apple told me that this product is already registered in their system and it is a used product. I was surprised to hear that. Upon contacting the seller, they never offered me a brand new ipad. They said if I keep this ipad they will give 25$ store credit or 3 year protection plan. I am returning the product now (shipping cost by me). buyers beware.one thing I noticed is the seller changes the name frequently. I would recommend buying Apple products from name brand store.	
298	3	4	4	4	4	3	1	4	0	2	4	4	I love my iPad. I would recomend the iPad for anyone who does a lot of traveling.. Countless apps, decent camera and video. Good battery life, pretty happy with it overall.

The service you provided was beyond my expectations. Fast, I ordered it, and 3 days later received it!!! Will purchase from you again. Thx a lot!!!	
300	4	4	4	3	3	3	0	2	0	0	4	4	iPad is easy. My iPad is easy to use, easy to recharge, and easy to synch with my iMac.  I just remember that it and my iPod are the 'children of my iMac.  My photos, music, and podcasts are now available in several formats.	
301	0	0	0	3	4	0	2	3	3	2	4	4	The product is excellent but your price is way over the price I would have paid directly dealing with Apple. I purchase this product believing it was the latest generation only to discover there is a newer model out for less money. Since receiving my Ipad, Apple has lower the price by more than $100.I am a very active Amazon customer and I was thoroughly surprised to find I was not given the best deal out on the market.	
302	4	4	0	4	4	0	4	3	3	2	4	4	iPad. I am enjoying the freedom and flexibility offered by this product.  Am still learning to use it, but having fun.	
303	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	0	1	1	4	4	Excellent. There is no word to say, it is an amazing stuff. I got five of 32gb to present my friends.	
304	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	0	4	1	4	4	Absolutely fantastic! Couldn't be happier! I bought mine directly from Apple in May, 2012. I got the Wifi + Cellular model for AT&T; so I could have the internet anywhere and everywhere. I have used my iPad every single day and absolutely love it!I resisted getting an iPad for a long time because I could not see a need for one. I already had a MacBook Pro and an iPhone so what would I do with an iPad? It seemed to be a blown up version of the iPhone (without the phone part) and an inferior version of the MacBook Pro (without the keyboard or processing power). So what the heck would I do with this iPad thing?As it turns out, I do a lot with it! I will admit that I play games on it a lot, but I also use it as my main "to go" item. I have it synced with my MacBook Pro and iPhone so it always contains anything that I consider important and want to always take with me (emails, notes, calendars, documents of various kinds, etc). It's my entertainment if I'm ever stuck anywhere, having to wait on something (the apps are much better on the iPad than my iPhone). I keep track of the weather and my kids (AT&T;'s Family Map plan), and the rush hour traffic (which can be a mess in the Houston area). Maps are easier to read and follow with the larger screen than they were on my iPhone. Even reading books is better on the iPad than the iPhone. And, yet, it's easier to carry around than my MacBook Pro; plus, with the cellular contract, I always have the internet available to me at all times.So as it turns out, the iPad does have its place even though I have a MacBook Pro and an iPhone. They each have their specific purposes. Even though I waited years before finally buying my first iPad, I cannot imagine not having an iPad now. And I'm very pleased with the model I selected as it runs all the current software very well and should be able to keep up with whatever comes out in the future for a long time before it becomes so obsolete that I'll have to buy a newer version. Most definitely an excellent buy!

Love this product. this was bought as a replacement to my ipad2 that was stolen recently. it works great and has provided great hours of working and game playing before the battery even goes dead. my kids have used it for three days and it finally needed a charge.

I have wanted an iPad ever since they were first launched and this year I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy one.I was so happy when I got it and I use it everyday. I really and truly love it and have it with me all the time. I have many apps on it for gaming and reading, gardening and connecting with family.My kids also are thrilled when they can have 15 minutes of iPad time when they are caught being extra good during the day. Some of the pre-school apps are wonderful for learning phonics and numbers.I have recently added several movies onto it and created an iPad holder to hang on the back of the passengers side seat so the kids can watch programs while we are on long trips.We enjoy this product so much and wish we had bought one sooner!

315	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	4	4	1	4	4	IPAD 3G. Love it already!!! The quality is superb! I can't wait to use it for my studying! Love the black outline.	
316	3	3	4	4	4	3	1	4	4	0	4	4	Love it. It works so good, thank you so much for the iPad. I hope your business gonna doing well in the future	
317	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	0	2	4	4	4	I'm very happy with this device. It works good, is helpful  and i use it very often. I would choose it a second time. Thank you.	
318	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	1	4	4	4	I love this thing. I love this thing. It is with me all day every day. I use it for everything from email, to a guitar tuner, to a night sky ovbservatory, to an art pad. I play guitar and have moved all my music to this thing including pairing it with a blue tooth page turner. It has never missed a beat and I've been using it daily for 6 months now. I saved a ton of money buying this over the latest model and have not sacrificed anything. The camera takes surprisingly good pictures too. Just buy it...you know you want one.	
319	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	0	2	4	4	4	Love it! I got this for my bf and he loves it!! It was kind of a bummer it didn't come in its original box but nonetheless a great gift.	
320	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	3	0	4	4	4	Exceeded my expectations. This ipad looked brand new when I took it out of the box and has functioned perfectly ever since.  Great buy.	
321	4	4	0	4	3	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	Finally, my own portable "computer" I don't want or need a smart phone, but this does the trick for me. If I want what it offers, all I do is open the case; if I don't,, I just leave it closed. Unlike the phone, it is only available on my terms.	
322	3	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	2	3	3	Works very well. Got the iPad for my mom as a Christmas gift. Wasn't looking to break the bank and wanted it to function well. It met both standards handily.	
323	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	3	1	1	4	4	The best 9.7 inch tablet I have ever used! What's included?The device is packaged nicely and the box includes the iPad charger rated at 2.1 Amps at 5.1 VDC. It also includes a USB to iPad cable for use with the power supply and it also interfaces with your computer to connect to iTunes. The cable is only 41 inches long which is always one of my pet peeves because when you plug the charger in the wall the cable is too short to allow you to reach to the top of a dresser for example and charge the product at night. The first thing you will do is buy a USB male to female extender cable or buy the Apple extended version charger at $29 cost to charge the unit properly.You also get a one page instruction card that basically says to turn on the unit and follow the directions. You also get the important product information guide and two white apple logos to use as you desire.Set up* Turn it on and select your language and touch next.* Select your country and touch next.* It will ask you if you want to have the unit identify the location of where you are at. Select yes as this is important for later tracking of the device if it is stolen.* Activate networks, which in my case was only WIFI. Select your SSID from the list of possible connections, enter in your password, if your network is protected. Touch next.* Activate your Apple ID using your e-mail address and your Apple password.* Accept the Apple terms.* It will then start a set up.* It asks if you want to use the cloud option for communication and uploading and downloading.* It asks if you want to use the dictation mode when you touch the microphone on the keyboard.* The iPad then does some diagnostics and loading.* It asks you if you are ready to register the product with Apple.* It then tells you that you are ready to use the iPad.Attach the unit to your computer that has iTunes installed, (make sure you are using the latest version):* When you plug in the iPad it asks if you want to set it up as a new iPad or to use the data of an existing iPad. I selected New iPad.* It asks you to select an iPad name. Make sure that it is unique so that you don't confuse iTunes into thinking you have two devices with the same name.* The iPad is set to auto sync and I stopped that as my music files are to large for the 64 GIG memory. I select only the music, videos, and photos I want to sync.* The unit will begin to sync your data and it will install all of your existing apps you own as long as you have not exceeded the limit of 5 Apple devices using those apps.* Your apps are all loaded as single apps and if you want you have to combine them into folders and name the folders. This took me about an hour as we own over 200 apps. The list was 10 pages long.* I then told the iPad to sync with my contacts, calendar and with two email accounts using Outlook. Don't forget you will have to enter in your ISP email account password for each email account you sync with before your e-mail will be down loaded.* All of these steps occurred without error and they happened very quickly. This unit is faster than the iPad 2 device and it clearly shows while processing these steps.Installing Kindle Reader app.* I use the Kindle reader app a lot and it was already installed above by the app installation process.* Touch the Kindle app and it will ask you for your Amazon ID and password. Almost instantly it tells you that you can look at your books in the Cloud and you will start to load up the book covers. Each cover will have a downward pointing arrow on it to indicate that it has not been downloaded to your device.* Touch each cover and the book will download. I have a very good WIFI and each book only took seconds. I own about 350 Kindle books and the process was very fast. You can touch 10 to 15 books and it will download them sequentially and very quickly.* When you are reading a book and want to look up a word in the dictionary, the first time it will ask you if you want to download the dictionary to your device. Select yes and it takes about 5 seconds to do this. Look up of words is virtually instantaneous.* You will notice the outstanding quality of the display as the text looks like a printed page with perfect resolution and dark text. It is impressive!Find iPhone* Touch the Find iPhone icon* Enter in your Apple ID and Password and touch Go.* The application will then locate all of your Apple devices assigned to your account. You can now look at each location either on a map or even a satellite view. If your iPad does not show up then go to settings and touch Location Services and turn on Find My iPad and Status Bar Icon. You will be able to locate your device within about 10 to 20 feet!* It is critical that you set this up as you can now track your device if it is lost or stolen!* You can also make the missing device, Play a Sound, Remote Lock, Remote Wipe, and even allow it to send you an e-mail when the device is found.SecurityThis is one of Apple's shining stars regarding security. By touching settings for example you can set Auto-Lock to on, select a Passcode Lock and set restrictions. By doing this you can lock your iPad with a simple or more complex passcode (recommended) so that if it is stolen you will not lose your data to a hacker. Under restrictions the list is 21 items long. You can give this device to a child and turn off the web browsing, social networks, buying games and products, dictation, installing and deleting apps, etc...This product is professionally designed and if you are giving this to a child (or even giving them an iPod) you can lock these features and feel secure that they have access to only the things you want them to have. You can even assign age limits for music, shows, movies, apps, etc.. It is the best security setup available today.Web browsingUnbelievably fast! This is where the strength of the new processor shows and the speed of the WIFI connection is wonderful. It is virtually as fast as my 1GHz wired Ethernet connected computer. The streaming of video is fast and flawless.Face TimeThe advantage of having a front and rear facing camera is that you can call anyone using a iPhone 4 or iPad 2 or the new iPad and talk to them and see them simultaneously if they are connected to a good WIFI connection. The new cameras on this iPad are 5 Mega pixels and you will see the difference immediately. The video and picture are extremely clear.Face Time is very nice and if you want you can even swap camera front to back so instead of the person you called seeing you they can see what you are seeing. This is a very nice and powerful feature.TypingTyping is smooth and fast. You cannot type with two thumbs (as the screen is too wide) and it is better to rotate the device to landscape mode and get a good sized keyboard to type on. I can almost type as fast on the iPad as I can on a full size computer keyboard.E-mailThis set up immediately and downloaded 50 e-mails into each account in about a minute. The e-mail system is easy to use and to respond on. It set up two email accounts for me in about 1 minute to set up and 1 minute to download the 50 e-mails.AppsApple has the best app store in the market. Amazon is getting better but Apple has a head start. Literally, "There is an app for that!" is not a joke but a reality. All of my 200 apps loaded via iTunes in about 20 minutes and we have a lot of them.CameraThe new 5 Megapixel camera is very nice. The quality is instantly recognizable in every photo and video you take. You actually record video in 1080P HD quality and between the camera and the display you will be amazed at how good the result is.There is no flash on the camera so that is an issue in low lighting.One of the advantages of the iPad is the number of high quality apps that can be used to tweak your photographs and make them look professional. We own several of these apps and the results can be spectacular. You can literally make a professional looking photography show using these apps and with this improved camera the results will even be better.Dictation and microphoneUsing the iPad Notes function you can touch the microphone on the keyboard and dictate to the iPad. I dictated this paragraph and it translated it to text with fewer typing errors than I did while typing this section. After you finish dictation, just retouch the microphone on the keypad and the voice recording will be converted to text.FacebookSet up of Facebook was fast and easy. Just enter your e-mail address and then your Facebook Password and you are on line. The quality of the pictures looks much better on the display as long as the person who set them up used a high quality photo.iTunes music and moviesI have input every CD and audio book I own into iTunes. I also have loaded MP4 movies into iTunes and they can be played on the iPad with very good results. They literally are HD quality. I purchased a 64 GIG version white iPad 3 to have the space to load as much music, photos, and videos as I can onto the device and use it for an entertainment center. I loaded 200 apps at 9.5 GIG and 350 Kindle books and I still have almost 48 GIG of free memory left for my other items!GamingI won't spend a lot of time here but just to say that we all know that the Apple products have some of the best gaming apps available. They vary from action games, sports games, strategy games, puzzle games and tower defense style games. Make sure that you buy the HD version of the games for the iPad in order to take advantage of the new display features.DisplayThe 9.7 Retina Display; 2048 x 1536 resolution produces razor sharp pictures and text. You simply have to see it to believe it. This screen has 3.1 million Pixels and is powered by a quad core graphics chip. The first three things I noticed were the quality of the pictures and videos and the text is crisper and darker.BatteryThis design has up to 10 hours of battery life even with all of these features. This makes the Apple iPad a truly enjoyable device when you know that you can listen to music, read, watch videos and work on photos for 10 hours and not have to worry about recharging or being tied to a power cable.Cons* No flash on the camera.* No 7" tablet available for a lower price and portability.* Power and connection cable 41" long, way too short in my opinion.* High price, demanded by the quality but still a gulp when you buy one!	
324	4	3	4	3	4	4	0	4	2	3	4	4	Amazing. If I were to really write how I feel about this product, my review would probably be banned as explicit. So I'll just say that the new iPad is __________________________.	
325	4	4	4	4	3	3	1	0	3	1	4	4	Nice Tablet, have a Kindle Fire to compare. This is a very nice tablet.  The screen is very clear and detailed.I have a Kindle Fire, so will compare that to the Ipad3.  I know they are priced much differently, but I have a Kindle and was questioning if the Ipad3 was a good upgrade.First the obvious:Apple has a bigger screen.IOS vs AndroidMain menus:The IPAD main menu scrolls smoother between screens and when opening applications.  The Kindle default Amazon interface is kind of lame and too simple, however I use a side loaded app called Go Launcher on the Kindle.Go Launcher has onscreen buttons for home and back (which is the same type of interface on an Android).  With the Ipad you have to press the hard button over to the side to go back to the home menu.On screen buttons like with Go Launcher are nice, example... if I am in email then open a url this will open up the web browser.  When I want to return back to that email I simply just press the onscreen back button while in web browser and this will take me back to the email I was just looking at.With the Ipad if you are in email and press on a url the web browser opens as normal, but you have to press the hard button to get out of the browser and back to the app menu, and then press the email app.  This seems kind of redundant to me.  Another option with the Ipad3 is you can hit the home button twice to access your open apps and press the email program.The Android onscreen navigation buttons are more intuitive for this purpose.Screen:The Kindle Fire screen looks very good but looking closely (12 inches away) I can still see the pixelation on smaller pictures.The Ipad Retina is for sure more clear and sharp.  The pictures are more vivid and detailed.  Text looks much sharper.Internet:Ipad3 web browsing is faster than the Kindle but there are still some occasional delays when scrolling down a webpage on the Ipad, but much less than the Kindle Fire.  Using the Safari browser is more responsive.  The larger screen on the IPAD3 is way nicer for web browsing.  With the Kindle Fire there is a lot more side scrolling going on and moving around the screen to browse the web.The onscreen keyboard:Ipad is very responsive and I don't feel like I have to guess if the onscreen key I hit was registered.The Kindle was not as responsive.  While the onscreen keyboard is good, there times when the Kindle just seems to hiccup and not register an onscreen key.Email:The Ipad built in email integrates with my MS Live account.The Kindle built in email doesn't work with MS Live, you have to get a different program which really sometimes does not pull up new email and the navigation is clunky.Music streaming:Pandora Radio works fine on both.  The Ipad has one speaker, and the Kindle has two for stereo affect.  The Kindle sound is very good for the price, but when tilted horizontally the speakers are on the left side and one of the speakers gets covered up when held up.  I think the Ipad3 sound is better, however the speaker faces away so the sound can be distant when propped up.Video streaming:Netflix on the Ipad3 is way better; the movies look clear and stream in HD.  The Kindle movies look blotchy and appear to be playing at a lower resolution.Google maps and locationing:Kindle Fire has no location positioning for locationing apps.The Ipad3, has no GPS, but can still use wireless positioning to locate the Ipad location like in Google Maps._____________So the Ipad3 is way better than the Kindle, surprise!!  My only gripe is there are no onscreen navigation buttons to jump to other applications.  Pressing the hard button is not a big issue, but I rather only use that button sparingly.I like the Ipad3 for most tasks including email, browsing the web, streaming movies.I like the Kindle Fire for compact use and I prefer the smaller size for traveling lightly.	
326	0	0	3	4	4	1	3	4	1	4	0	4	Good way of wasting money. First of all I want to point out that I own an Ipad (first edition) and Ipad2. I need a tablet primarily to work with e-mail, read and listen to the news (cnbc and others), watch movies and listen to the music on the go. And if a product is well made and of good quality I'm not going to buy something else just because it is NEW, but actually doesn't offer substantially better experience. Not only new Ipad doesn't offer something that would made it different from previous models (for example possibility of installing  windows , or Adobe Flash etc.), but I have serious doubts about its quality. Based on my previous experience the quality of first Ipad is not that good ( It worked well for almost 2 years, but then one day just died), and I doubt that Ipad 3 quality is any better. I am most certainly not going to be buying a tablet that has 2 years life period (and who knows maybe even less). And it really pisses me off that a lot of times instead of graphics and charts you see empty space or you cannot listen to an interview. In my opinion right now Apple is making money on a smart marketing strategy, but not on an innovative product.	
327	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	1	3	0	4	4	Great at what it is intended to do. If you like reading books, watching TV shows or Movies, and playing games, then this device is perfect. However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about. I've rarely had difficulty finding a hot spot at any destination I've travelled to.	
328	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	I-pad 3. Got it for my wife, she loves it see her playing with it all the time!!! dont know much about it myself but as long as she is happy, you know the rest!	
329	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	4	3	1	4	4	My Amazon review of the new iPad. Excited about getting an iPad,I didn't really consider if my petswould enjoy it too.The dog loves to jump in my lapas I'm running from dinosaurs,or jamming in a one man band,or watching videos about much cuter dogs.He craves the attentionthis lifeless and wagless thing achieves.My cat ignored it, until one day,Nicole googled "apps for cats."He pawed at a little red ball dartingacross the infinite blackness.I wonder what a feline astronaut would seeperched at the window of a rocketship,and whether he would wonder at how humansspend more and more money onwhat are poor substitutes forthe scurrying mouse, the tossed sock,the vacant corner of a midnight room.	
330	4	4	4	3	0	4	1	3	3	4	3	4	Ipad 3!!! I bought this to get myself to go out and give myself a freedom to use whenever i need to so I don't have to run around looking for WIFI when I need to use the internet.  I'm a big apple products fan and I've had iPad 1, iPad 2 and now this iPad 3 with 4G.  I love how apple's quality is all the time and appreciate the superior design.  It solid and works great!  BUT I'm returning this product since I found cheaper solution with signing up 4G Hotspot which I can connect multiple devices with at the same time so I can just use my iPad 2 wifi on the hotspot with my kids Idolpad Plus tablets at the same time using the hotspot.  This is great product but for my budget, I'm getting 1 more idolpad plus tablet(android tablet for just over $100) for my other kid and just signing up for 4G hotspot is a lot cheaper and everyone could be on the internet at the same time.  So it works out better for me.  Only if iPads were a little cheaper I wish..	
331	4	4	2	4	4	1	1	0	4	4	4	4	as expected. Can't really add much to the already known facts.  Am enjoying reading my free books: Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Adventures of Huck. Finn, and now of Sherlock Holmes.as per Gutenberg press.  Am finding more apps to make it even more useful.	
332	4	3	4	4	4	1	1	4	2	1	4	4	Almost a computer replacement. This little thing is amazing (32gb wifi black).  I haven't had the heat issues that I see mentioned.  I don't know if it's that I got it in July instead of March or I just got lucky.  The only time I noticed a temperature difference was with Netflix, and I thought that was completely to be expected frankly.  It is processor intensive use after all.I find it very comfortable to hold, especially in the leather folio I purchased to carry it in.  It's like carrying around a fairly normal weight book, which is pretty astounding in it's own right.But I daily experience awe at the power this thing has.  From business applications to photo editing to games, this does almost everything I use my computer for.  If I didn't need real Photoshop, a huge hard drive, or struggle over some of the websites that apple refuses to support (ahem flash), I might be able survive with the ipad alone.  I won't, but I almost could.The resolution is magnificent.  I prefer using to it to read now.I love that most of the apps I use I can sync with iCloud so I can switch back to my laptop with no hassle.  I love that all my music is on iTunes Match now so I can listen to anything in my list while I'm out and about.  There is so much to love here!If I had any complaints, I would say the camera needs a flash.  It's fairly silly to assume that what you are photographing will be in the right light.  It's much more likely that it won't.  So that's kind of a bummer.  I can't figure out a fix for this one.Syncing with my google accounts was a bit of hassle.  I had to read up on how to make my google contacts sync with the native contacts app.  But once it was set up then I didn't have to think about it.The really short cord was kind of annoying especially with the suggestion that we ought to remain tethered to the outlet.  I solved that issue with a really long usb extension cord!  Luckily it was something I had already.All in all I really like this thing.  I'm glad I got it.	
333	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	0	0	4	3	4	Pretty good but slow. It's good. Downloads can be slow. Lots of ads that aren't asked for at inappropriate times. It's always evolving and you never know if you purchased the best one.	
334	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	My first iPad. I have owned iPhones for a few years now, and this is my first iPad. I love it! My only complaint is the typing-- iPhones and I guess iPads too don't like my fingers too much but I may purchase an external keyboard soon.  It is fast, has Siri (with the newest software update), excellent voice recognition, excellent camera, etc. I have been playing around with the included photo booth and the iPad3 is by far my newest and most fun toy!	
335	4	4	3	3	4	0	3	1	1	4	4	4	Best Apple Ipad Ever! This Apple Ipad first generation is perfect for people who have kids. As a child with four siblings, I know this is true.  It is only about a few centimeters thick and can contain all the games you love, your calendar, the internet, and so much more. It isn't too small so that you can't read anything on it, but it isn't too big so you can take it places.  You can download games for the kids and have your apps also. My mom and dad will use the Ipad when they need to look something up or check the calendar. I love to play card games and watch movies on Netflix. Everyone in my family has their own app that they can always go on.  The only downside is how the internet connection is set up. My older siblings and I like to go on the internet to check our emails and facebooks. On the ipad first generation you can't get on the internet unless you have wifi. When we are on road trips we can't see what our friends are up to.  The people who wouldn't like this product would be people who need internet connection everywhere they go. That's alright because there is another ipad for that, but for me the Apple Ipad first generation is perfect for me.	
336	3	3	4	0	4	0	4	4	3	4	4	4	1st Apple product. Using Amazon Prime seems to always be a joy and this was no exception. My apple iPad 3 arrived in seeminglyperfect condtion, ordered as a new unit, and I have been having the greatest time learning how to use it. Therewas 1 surprise and that was finding a 'Moon' shot of some ones ass already in my photo section. I am still tryingto clear it away completely. Any thoughts anyone?Jim Johnson	
337	3	0	4	4	4	4	0	3	0	4	4	4	IPad 3. I normally try to avoid Apple products, bit I'm glad I bought this. Granted the left side gets slightly warm while using it but it's hardly noticeable. You really have to be looking for defects and not be fair to write a bad review on this Tab. I had an Asus EEE Pad Transformer that was awesome when it worked, unfortunately it crashed every two and a half weeks, I've owned the IPad for almost a month and a half still runs like day one.The only thing that bothers me about it is it's lack of a flash player, but there is probably a patch for it and since I'm not an Apple guy I don't know of it.	
338	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	very pleased. What's not to like especially when I can work from home, watch a movie, read a book, browse the internet and use it in the classroom with educational aps for the kids. Haven't used the camera yet.The teenager is constantly trying to get her hands on it. But I do confess that when I cannot figure something out the teen can, so its a trade off at times.	
339	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	New ipad. No complaints here love my new ipad!  Did not wait long to get it and it was everything I was promised.	
340	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	0	1	3	3	I like it, but wish it had some Android-like features. I picked this up a little over 2 weeks ago at my local Best Buy and really wasn't impressed when I started using it. I always wondered why there was so much hype surrounding Apple products. It's a beautiful tablet, both the body and the screen. I just thought Apple would've shaken things up a bit instead of using the same mundane icon layout etc. The good thing is that it gets the work done that I need, the extras that I want are just not there. For example, no auto-fill when typing URL's, lack of Flash player, no built in HDMI port, no notepad for me to write on unlike the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and the so-so sound quality. I've gotta tell ya, the Kindle HD sounds way better. There are some other features I wish the iPad had, but I won't get into that.What I'll say is that I like the sturdiness. It feels like they used good quality material to construct this. Battery life is simply amazing, I rarely need to charge it. It connects quickly to the internet. I like the sharp retina display, the ease of transitioning from one app or website to another. It's very smooth, the best I've seen in any tablet and I've purchased and returned a few in my quest to find a really good one (Kindle Fire HD, Blackberry Playbook, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 & the Asus Transformer TF700T). I think Apple got me by the sheer volume of apps they have and so many of them are free! It's amazing to have such a vast array of apps that are dedicated to this one product.I like it enough to keep it plus I'm tired of returning tablets. I'll just have to learn how to manipulate it. The owner's manual online should really help with this.	
341	4	4	2	4	1	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	new iPad. Sensational item, good as advertised. It is classy. Don't know why it took me so long to buy it, although it is not inexpensive.	
342	4	0	4	3	0	0	1	0	4	4	4	4	Had to return one of three, not sure of others yet. Ordered three iPads, not getting any reduction in price, but needed them quickly and no Apple stores nearby. One was entirely broken, had to be returned. Returned it and replaced it with one from  the Apple store and got a lot of extra service by doing so. Would not purchase again from Amazon if an Apple store is nearby. Love the iPads. Combined with the Logitech Ultrathin keyboard it replaces a laptop for a low tech user. He reads library books, the newspaper, follows weather and the financial markets, emails and is a happy camper.	
343	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	review. I love it very nice and way better than nexus 7 which i had before this one. I really enjoy this product.	
344	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	0	4	0	2	2	Is this REALLY the Newest Model? The ad on July 21, 2012 reads it is the latest model and quotes the Apple latest model price on Apple's web site today, $829 as the price from which it is discounted- But then the ad here also states it has the A5 processor- The latest generation IPAD has an A6 processor. I want the latest model with the A6 processor. Because of the conflicting information in the ad, and given the specificity of the statement that the processor is an A5, I am afraid to purchase from this ad because it might be a gen 3 for essentially the price of a gen 4, but does not have the gen 4's processor.

346	4	3	4	4	4	4	1	3	4	4	2	2	Bad. Sims card was bad. New iPad with a bad sims card, that's not good. Had to take it too a local store to find out what the problem was.	
347	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	0	4	4	4	4	Love Love Love it. Best thing I have purchased so far I use it every day I use it for everything and take it everywhere oh did I say I love it well I Love it	
348	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	1	2	4	3	3	Toy-ish. A "Paying for the name" tablet.  If your prioritary to Apple, then this is for you.  If not there are a few others that rival this item.  Arrived a bit cracked, but the packaging was excellent.  Perhaps the cold helped.  IPAD for me are more for the artsy fartsy lie, which I am.  But the cost just for a qualified "tool" of art, without the computer back up was too much for my finances.	
349	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	2	4	1	4	4	very good. very good experience, I recommend it widely, the shipment arrived on time. the product was exactly the that I wanted	
350	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	3	1	4	4	Retina!! Best part of this is the amazng retina display. I contemplated between the ipad 2 and this model for a while before making the decision to get this one...Im glad I did.

353	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	4	No es lo que esperaba... Y me refiero a que en ningún lugar de la publicación dice que el iPad es refurbished. Debería exigirse al vendedor publicar esa condición.

355	4	4	4	4	4	1	3	3	4	3	4	4	Love it! I love my ipad. Can't stand to be without it. The best thing since sliced bread. Entertaining and so much fun	
356	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	1	4	4	Love it (and I'm a hybrid user) I wasn't sure how much I'd like the iPad 3rd Generation as I am a devout Android phone user. Having said that I also own and use a MacBook Pro and iMac daily. Love how easy it is to use any app I load on this. Performance has been flawless and I don't regret not getting one that uses a phone carrier for data. If I don't have Wi-Fi available where I'm at, I simply fire up a Wi-Fi hotspot on my Samsung Galaxy S III and I'm good to go.Consider some type of flip case an essential accessory!	
357	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	1	4	4	4	Fast and awesome. I got this iPad about 3 weeks and I love it.  A lot faster on the Internet than iPad 1 & 2 I guess the processor are faster and newer.  The screen is much, much better compare to iPad 1 & 2 side by side...retina display is crystal clear in HD.  The only cons I guess is the iPad itself is a little hot after a long period of use.  Other than that the iPad is really great	
358	0	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	1	0	4	4	Very handy and convenient. It is so much easier than a laptop to tote and use when traveling. The thing that I don't like is that it doesn't work with adobe flash player, though I have been able to live without it.  I use it practically every day in some form, if just listening to the music that is stored on it or an internet radio app. There are plenty of apps to choose from both free and pay for. The battery life is amazing. I can use it for short periods of times throughout the day and not have to recharge for days. The picture quality is excellent, but I would have liked stereo speakers over the mono speaker.	
359	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	2	4	0	4	4	Great product - I highly recommend. I've had older models of this item, and this is the best one yet. I didn't think I needed a camera, but it comes in handy and is very nice. And the improvement in the quality of picture and video is definitely noticeable. Voice-to-text works well, way better than I expected, since you can select which dialect you speak so it'll understand you. I love this and I recommend it to anyone who's in need of an electronic personal assistant, a personal free-games device, or a portable movie-streaming machine - I've known it to be great at being all of these things.	
360	3	4	4	0	4	4	3	3	1	4	4	4	It is what you expect from a Apple product. I upgraded from the iPad 1 to the iPad 3, this is a great upgrade. My wife has a iPad 2 and there is not a lot of an upgrade from 2 - 3 but I would defiantly suggest an upgrade from iPad1 to iPad 3. As far as the Wi-Fi I did not want another Bill for the 3-G and in the country that I live in you can tether from your phone. So that was not an issue for me I do use my iPad every day but I do not use the internet outside of the house every day. I do tether sometimes but it is not that important to me.	
361	4	4	4	4	0	2	0	0	3	3	4	4	Great device. I pondered this for 2 years then finally bought one, but 2 weeks early because the 128Gb version is out now.

However, if you plan on watching a whole lot of Netflix etc battery may last a long time but takes equal amount of time to charge up again :(.  Still a excellent Product!	
369	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	4	0	0	4	4	Great alternative for an expensive GPS and in general just nice device. I use mine in a portfolio case for work and then in a LifeProof waterproof case for use in an offroad vehicle for GPS with no phone signal. Make s a huge GPS display much larger than even very expensive Lowrance or similar systems. Use RAM mounts for any mounting needed. Many apps for GPS ... works great deep in the forest. Fair battery life.

After very little use for 52 days beyond warranty, during watching a video the sound stopped. I called support and went through a hard reset but still it did not work. I took it to the apple repair shop and I was told that this is a common problem with the ipad 2 and 3 and that the loud speaker has to be changed for the cost of $78.57 plus tax.I was vwery disappointed because I always believed that Apple did a good job with quality and did not expect this from them. If Apple had  a problem it had to recall or at least replace at no cost.

377	3	1	4	4	3	1	4	3	4	4	3	3	It does everything! I use my ipad for everything. It has pretty much become my new computer. I gave it 4 stars though, because it'll randomly shut off while I'm in the middle of something. I don't know if that has something to do with the OS or just the one I have. I guess like every tech gadget, it doesn't work 100% of the time, only 99%.	
378	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	0	4	4	1	1	I was misled. This ipad was advertised as new but is not. Not only did it not come in the box but it has a nick in the edge. I kept it because being used is ok but this ipad was advertised as new.

If you have ever used another tablet (like an android) you will appreciate how easy to use an ipad is. I would recommend protecting this device with a case like the Griffin so that the ipad will work for a long time to come. This device is a very versatile tool!	
384	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	0	2	4	4	great buy. This was a great price for a great product.  I didn't want to spend the money on a new product I wasn't sure would suit my purposes.  I am still learning but so far working really well...thanks

388	4	4	2	4	4	1	3	3	3	4	4	4	Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead? UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are "post-paid" and "pre-paid."  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can "suspend" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.	
389	4	4	4	4	2	3	3	1	4	3	4	4	Totally worth upgrading from iPad 1st generation or if you have never had an iPad before! This is the iPad to get. If you have never owned an iPad before or are still using your 1st generation iPad, it is time to give in and buy one of these babies. The screen is beautiful. You know your nice HD tv at home? This has 1 million MORE pixels than that TV! It's got 1GB of ram, a faster A5X processor, and still manages to keep the 10 hour battery life! What more can you ask for?This is one of the best travel devices ever. Load it up with some games, movies, music, magazines and even books! You can travel internationally and not have to worry about running out of battery mid flight.  I love my iPad and it will continue to go with me on every flight I make to keep me entertained.

Received my New IPAD 32G WIFI only right on time on March 16 and promptly unboxed it and restored my latest IPAD 2 backup.  My anticipation was excited by the many articles I've read claiming that the new display is everything from your first experience seeing HDTV to a blind man getting sight.Since I had shelled out the cash for the new one and promised a family pass down for the old I was out of pocket about $1200.  So you can imagine my disappointment when I turned it on and saw nothing dramatically different from the IPAD 2.  OK let's get them both out and compare side by side.  More disappointment as there seems to be almost no difference in the visuals.  My first taught was they shipped me an IPAD 2 by mistake.  Weight, thickness, larger camera and a serial number check proved it was definitely a 3rd generation tablet.I have now had it for more than 24 hrs and can positively report I have gone from totally disappointed to thoroughly impressed.Why:Visuals from a distance of about 3 ft. when I made my comparison looked about the same but when you put It on your lap to view it at a more normal distance the display starts to pop and everything from text to pictures to movies look phenomenal.The camera is finally capable of taking excellent photographs and the HD video is with anti shake is very high quality.  Bringing photos up in IPhoto makes them look more like a printed glossy and very 3D like.Internet sites load very quickly and seem more crisp especially when you blow the size up or view a video full screen.  Download speeds tested out about 50% higher than the 2 and so did the links.My favorite racing game "Real Racing HD" issued an update to run on the new iPad screen and so I tried it out.  WOW first off the cars in the garage now have a life like appearance.  The game itself played very smooth at very fast speeds and the visuals were outstanding.  Even games that have not been updated yet played and looked much better.I read a lot and it was important to me that the books and online articles would provide a better experience and less eye stain than the iPad 2.  Too early to tell about the eye strain but the text on iBooks was noticeably better and pages turned smoothly.  The kindle app text was also better but pages were jerky and did not turn properly. Checked out flip boards new updated app and again the articles were all eye catching and pictures were outstanding to look at.So now I've gone from very disappointed to thoroughly impressed and glad to hand over my iPad 2.

Of course the NEW IPAD is everything the IPAD 2 is and better but I'm very dissapointed with the Fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating Apple claims it has, the finger smudges are as visible and annoying as they were in the IPAD 2.Also Apple failed to inform that they had changed the polarity in the IPAD so not all covers in the market ( from third parties) activate the cover lock/unlock option in the settings menu.I bought a non -apple cover with my new IPAD and found it didn't work the lock/unlock option, when I tried the apple cover it did work. My freind used my cover on the IPAD 2 and it worked fine, it just didn't work on the NEW IPAD.So be careful when buying a cover that is not from Apple.	
392	4	2	4	4	4	1	3	3	3	4	4	4	Everyone asked for retina display and we got it, love it! I'm very happy with the retina display and my new iPad. I am surprised at the reaction of so many that say thicker and heavier. I hadn't noticed until I read it LOL I looked it up and here are the specsThe new hew Third Generation iPad isDepth: 0.37 inch (9.4 mm)Weight: 1.44 pounds (652 g)The iPad2 isDepth: 0.34 inch (8.8 mm)Weight: 1.33 pounds (601 g) .11 of an ounce heavier in weight  and .03 of an inch in thickness are microtads. I didn't even notice it!The performance is much better than that of my iPad 2, when you look at the new iPad then the iPad 2 next to it, the high quality of the new display it is very apparent. That on the iPad 2 looks more pixelated and washed out next to it. It has more memory than the iPad 2 did, and I'm very pleased with the updated camera, the dictation feature, more memory and mine does not get hot.If you are hot happy they let you return it for 30 days no questions asked. The Wi-fi connection is great, I did not want to be tempted by the LTE connection I do not need more bills with a carrier for data, my smartphone is enough for me there. I highly recommend the new iPad. The display alone and the 4 quad core graphics capabilities from the new larger battery, camera and dictation features are well worth the upgrade. If you only browse the web or read email etc you're probably better suited to the iPad 2 or first generation iPad. I also picked the 64 gb this time being it's only $100 to double the size of the 32gb so I would not regret it later. Why does Amazon and the sellers have the price 50 to 100 dollars and higher for the cost of the iPad than it actually is? You might want to try Apple online or an Apple store for the actual price.	
393	3	4	4	4	4	1	1	3	0	4	4	4	Couldn't wait to get it. Was glad when it arrived!  Shipper requires a signature and new rules by the Post Ofc caused a delay of three days for me.  P.S. download the user guide of the website, cuz nothing as in paperwork comes with it.	
394	4	4	2	4	4	1	3	3	4	2	4	4	OWNED IPAD 1, 2 AND NOW 3. No long review or repeat of specs here...Weight and size are virtually unnoticeable although its a bit thicker.....Fits in the original iPad 1 case. I've used this case for all three iPads....It does run a bit hot....  Processor is faster.. Screen is very very clear....Still slow battery charge and NO FLASH player.... I would not have purchased iPad 3 but the company I work for gives us points to spend each quarter and had enough points to purchase this iPad....It's really quite nice.....iPad 2 resale is a no brainer.  Just tell everyone at work you want to sell your iPad...It takes about a day.  eReaders are for old folks (because they actually know how to read) nothing compares to an iPad.  Other tablets are just wanna be's......I have enjoyed owning iPad...I use it with a Verizon Samsung 4g LTE.... at Dr's appt.'s, at lunch, during break time, at work.....They slowly keep getting better and better..	
395	4	4	3	4	4	0	0	3	4	0	4	4	NEW i Pad review. I have owned all different models of iPad. From First one to the latest I pad. The main thing that immediately gets your attention on the new I pad is the resolution. Specially the text. Other than that, it is very similar to the I pad II.	
396	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	0	1	4	4	Retina display makes it. I'm glad I waited for the retina display in the new iPad rather than buying earlier or opting for the less expensive iPad 2. It's remarkable what a difference it makes. I'm a scientist and read a lot of journal articles (mostly as PDFs), and this display makes them just about as good as paper. There is no strain to read on the screen like on my desktop computer which looks, in comparison now, quite blurry. It is seriously hard to overstate how much better the retina display makes for reading.The only downside is that there is not a good app yet for writing papers along with a citation manager. I hope that comes soon.	
397	3	2	4	0	2	0	0	3	4	1	4	4	The only tablet you'll need. I was hunting around for a tablet as I had never bought one before and I wanted something smaller than a regular laptop/netbook. This baby does the trick. Its a little more pricey than some of the other tablets on the market but as they say you get what you pay for and apple knows tablets. I've gotten so many free apps that are quite marvelous, I've been able to access all of my e-mail accounts, keep up on the latest soccer and basketball news as well as download books on the Kindle App from Amazon's site. Totally worth the cash and I do have a Android phone so I'm hardly tied to Apple. Very happy with this purchase, you'll wonder how you got along without it	
398	4	4	2	4	4	4	1	3	4	2	4	4	good product. this came reallly well and works perfectly , arrived on time and came with no damages , the only thing i dont like is that the ipad 3 came without headphnes -_-

400	0	4	2	4	4	2	4	4	4	0	2	2	Do your research before you buy! Apple released iPad 4 less than 30 days from my purchase. I Paid full price for an item that is obsolete before the new is even worn off. I will consider this if I buy Apple again. Probably won't.	
401	4	4	0	4	3	0	3	1	2	0	4	4	Excellent Product AND Amazon Rocks! . Received the IPAD quickly and in excellent condition (Amazon provides great service).  Outstanding product, the new Retina display is absolutely awesome!  After a few days I noticed that Apple was releasing a new model IPAD, one with a faster processor, better camera, etc.  I returned my IPAD to Amazon with no problems or delay in getting my credit card reimbursed since I was well within the Amazon return period.  Amazon rocks!  They provide unequaled service to the customer - great products, quick deliveries, reasonable prices and an outstanding return policy.  Whenever I want to buy anything, Amazon is the first place I visit and, almost all the time, where I buy my item(s).	
402	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	2	4	4	Great experience. Thought the product may show wear and tear, but looked brand new.  Product worked as it should and I would use this vendor again.	
403	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	0	2	3	4	Ipad. Ipad is great, however it didn't come with a simm card. I bought it for my son,now I have to get myself one.

406	3	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	0	4	4	4	Ipad 3. Crystal clear. I bought this product used, and it was like brand new. I also bought it mainly for the 4G LTE service. (Verizon)Works great, super fast, and long battery life. Love it!	
407	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	Dead on arrival, but came back to life. What more can I say?  Opened box, doesn't turn on.  Great as a book end or door stop, but not very useful as a tablet.The tablet suddenly turn on two weeks after we got it. I bought it for my daughter and she ended up giving birth a little early and didn't end up being able to deal with it.  It turned on just as she was about to box it up and send it back.	
408	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	0	0	4	4	4	the best yet! This has to be the best I Pad yet.  I just love it.  It arrived quickly, was well packaged, and as described.

My IPad came right on time as expected and when the description said like brand new they might as well have put BRAND NEW there wasnt a scratch smudge or anything on it.. It was Perfect in everyword. It came in its original packaging and everything was in the box as stated Im completely in Love with my New IPad i cant stay off of it.. I will definently be looking for other products from you guys Thanks So Much , Erika M.	
411	3	4	3	4	3	1	4	2	3	0	4	4	User friendly. I love how user friendly it is.  The more I use it, the more functions I discover.  The camera quality is exceptional!	
412	4	2	4	3	4	0	0	2	4	2	4	4	As Expected. arrived in sealed box in new condition.  turned on and started using immediately.  performs as expected.  no surprises.  great purchase.	
413	4	3	3	4	4	1	0	4	4	4	3	3	First foray into tablets and I like it. I went with Apple b/c I have a ton of apps on my ipod touch and I wanted inter-compatability. I haven't been disappointed.	
414	4	4	4	4	4	1	3	3	4	3	2	2	Good, but ..., I've been a big iPad fan and was waiting anxiously for the third generation to come out. I bought the original iPad, and when the 2 came out, I happily sold the 1 and upgraded. I was thrilled with the thinner, lighter and improved iPad 2. So naturally, when word came out that the third one was about to be released in March 2012, I was right on board to buy one. Sold my 2 and preordered the 3 from Apple the day it was released.I was hoping the third gen wouldn't be noticibly thicker and heavier than the 2, but unfortunately it was. I could definitely tell the difference when reading ebooks, which I do a lot. I couldn't really tell any difference between the speed and clarity of the 3, but to be fair, I didn't compare the two models side by side. I've no doubt the 3 is superior in this regard. I don't use the cameras, so don't care about this since I have a very nice digital camera for that.The one thing about the third generation iPad that concerned me was the heat issue. Shortly after receiving it, I was reading an ebook and noticed the left side was warm. Not hot, but definitely warm enough for me to notice it. This reminded me of laptops I've had that have overheated and shut down, and here I was only reading a book. My iPad 2 never had this problem and I used it a lot. I also had some difficulty backing up the 3 to the cloud, again, something that wasn't ever a problem with the 2.After reading some reviews of others experiencing the heating problem with the latest iPad, and really missing the thinner and lighter iPad 2 , I decided to return the iPad 3 to my local Apple store and buy a new iPad 2. They had no problem taking it back and I was glad to see the 2 had come down in price. When the sales associate asked me why I was returning the 3, I told him about the heat problem. He didn't seem surprised and said it was because the 3 has a larger battery.The third gen has a faster CPU and retina dsplay, but I never thought the 2 had any problems with speed, and the clarity of the display has always seemed fine to me. But I'm certainly no expert. I'm very happy I made the exchange and enjoying using my iPad 2 again. For my uses--books, internet, email and games, the cooler, thinner and lighter iPad 2 is a better choice for me.By the way, I just want to add that I think it's unfair to compare the Kindle Fire and Nook to the iPad. These devices are just ebook readers and they're fine for that--I've tried them both. Rather like saying, okay, you can buy this Mercedes or you can get the Volkswagen. Once you've used an iPad, you're totally spoiled and trying to browse the Internet with a Kindle or Nook is an exercise in frustration after using an iPad.	
415	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	1	0	4	4	It's a must. Our family is so connected to iTunes it would be hard for us to move to another tablet although I love additional storage options with the Android and Microsoft tablets.  I recently bought this iPad for my mom and it's perfect for her.  My 6 year old daughter has had an iPad for a couple years now - it was a hand me down so she is able to easily help her grandmother to get to know her new iPad.  I recommend the iPad to all who need a simple device and aren't too concerned about storage.	
416	2	4	4	4	4	3	2	0	3	4	4	4	Wonderful for home use. I work with computers each day at work and just wanted something for emails at home.  This is perfect!  I also bought the Otter Box for protection.  I have had the iPad for about six months and am very happy with it.	
417	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	2	4	4	4	it is perfect, I love it. I love it, it is cheaper and good quality than I expected. I will come back to buy any more.

419	0	0	4	2	4	0	4	4	3	0	0	0	Buyer BEWARE of TechGiant -- Does not honor Apple's 1-year warranty. Be very wary of purchasing any tech products from TechGiant.Purchased a 3rd gen ipad from them via Amazon and 8 months later the speaker stopped working.  Contacted Apple with the ipad's serial number and they said it did not exist or was never registered.  Ask TechGiant for assistance and they said they do not offer any warranty over the standard 30 days via Amazon.I asked TechGiant about the 1-year warranty on hardware that comes with all Apple products and TechGiant said that they cannot honor that as they do not know how long the devices have been sitting on their own shelf.  They said that if they bought the ipad from their distributor 6 months before a customer buys it on Amazon from them, there would only be 6 months left on the Apple warranty.This is absolutely not stated on the product page and we were VERY DISAPPOINTED with TechGiant!!!BUYER BEWARE of TechGiant!!!  Ask the how long the "new" device has been sitting on their "shelf" before they sell it to you.  I would never deal with this seller again.  You are better off buying directly from the Apple store.	
420	4	4	4	4	2	3	1	4	0	3	4	4	Changed my life. What's here to say about an iPad that hasn't been said already? It's totally useful and awesome. It will probably change your relationship to your significant other because now you can internet whenever and that will annoy them. But oh, the things you can do with your iPad!	
421	4	3	3	4	4	3	4	2	2	2	2	3	4 Star. I gave this item a great rating because it is fast , advanced and very easy to manuver thru the different sites. The only thing is that i stalls sometimes, going into the other websites and flickers with something else you did not ask for

425	4	4	0	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	4	4	Excellent. Excellent product!!! I have finally taken the plunge and purchased my first apple product. The experience so far has been wonderful. I read a number of reviews before making this purchase and I have no regrets	
426	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	2	0	4	4	Blows away the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. I usually don't feel so inclined to write product reviews, but I have to say this iPad is really worth a purchase. I used Mac computers for nearly 20 years before switching to a PC. When I got my first smartphone, 4 years ago, it was an Android. I still use an Android global phone. So when it was time to try a tablet, I figured I should get the Samsung Galaxy Tab as it would be compatible with all my Android apps that I had spent a *lot* of time finding and testing. What I got was a 32GB model that was a complete flop. I was incredulous. How could my phone (Droid Incredible 2) work better, faster, and more smoothly than the Tab? So I kept if for a month or so, trying to tweak it in every way imaginable to make it work better.When I decided it just wasn't happening, I got an iPad 3rd gen. I was blown away by everything from the typing experience, the number of great accessories (typing this with a Zaggfolio keyboard case) and its incredibly smooth operation. It is so amazing that for the first time in 4 years I'm thinking about buying an iPhone next time around. What I notice is that you can simply enjoy the tablet, instead of killing times trying to make it work better. It just works perfectly to begin with. My only consideration now would have been to get at least the 32 GB model. Different than Android, apps for the iPad are much larger in size. A typical 2MB app on my android might be 20mb on the applie, making the memory evaporate pretty quickly. Still, I use it mostly for reading books and sending emails, or buying something on line, so I think the 16gb should suffice.Do yourself a favor and get this tablet. You won't regret it.	
427	3	3	4	4	0	0	4	2	4	4	4	4	Verizon iPad 4g LTE. The iPad was shipped promptly and I received it a day ahead of schedule. I already had an iPad 2 which I gave to my wife. The display on the new one is somewhat sharper and crisper with the extra pixels. However the biggest improvement is the 4g data speed. If your in the market for an iPad I would spend the extra money and get the LTE data speed.	
428	4	4	4	4	4	3	0	0	4	0	4	4	Excellent. Excellent service. The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I'm happy with this purchase and with my product. I recommend it.

433	4	3	0	0	4	4	0	2	4	4	3	4	Still hard to beat the iPad. When iPad was first introduced to the world, it was better that sliced better and man walking on the moon. Since then, companies who compete with Apple have released several different kinds of tablets which happen to become very popular BUT none of them can come close to the iPad. Each generation of iPad become smarter, more capable and more useful then that previous version. I got my iPad2 as a Christmas gift and I have been using it every day and I am loving it. Having said all the good thing about the iPad, I am disappointed that iPad does not have retina display like the iPhone but I have heard iPad3 has retina display and that alone will set it far apart from every other tablet. I will definitely recommend it!!	
434	0	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	Love It!!! I bought this for my 54 yr old husband who is "TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGED". He struggles with texting on his cell phone...for heavens sake! If there is any kind of problem with computers, phones or internet, I have to figure it out.I bought this tablet for him and he absolutely loves it! A chimpanzee can use it. There are no user manuals that he has to read...just turn it on. He carries it everywhere.I researched pricing and Amazon.com was the best deal by far PLUS it arrived in 3 days! Amazing! I would highly recommend the IPAD for anyone who gets overwhelmed with technology and even for grandparents (it has skype)! It is worth the money!	
435	3	0	4	3	4	0	2	4	2	4	4	4	Good to have for Kindle, "webbing" and emailing. This is my first Apple product, so it's been a voyage of adventure...PROSBuild quality and ergonomics are first rate - a truly high quality product.The Retina display screen is exceptionally sharp and clear when compared to a friend's "iPad 2".Relatively crash proof and simple to operate (once the "operations code" is broken)Choice of applications is truly mindbending, likely the best feature of the unitSeamless updating and syncing with iTunesCONSApple's thought processes and symbology are different from PC developers, so there has been a learning curve for moi...  I can move around and activate any feature on any Windows PC without a hitch...  Apple has its own way of doing business...iPad "multitasking" is brain dead compared to Windows machines, and the inability to use Flash based websites due to the Apple/Adobe feud is asinine.  Fortunately, an app named iSwifter allows Flash based content to play on the iPad, so all is not totally lost, but iSwifter is not particularly user friendly.Recharging time seems to be long, compared to an ASUS netbook and a pair of HP laptops I haveAm unable to charge the iPad via the PC-to-iPad USBHaving problems updating apps via the iPad... have to update on my PC, then sync with the iPad...  minor annoyanceHas a proprietary power/docking connector, but converter cables to HDMI or USB are available.I enjoy using the iPad for webbing and email access nearly anywhere, plus the apps that figuratively and literally make the iPad sing.  Not new to an Apple-phile, but is really great for a newbie.Overall, am glad I purchased the iPad, and look forward to learning more about how it runs best...6 MONTH UPDATE - Upgraded from 4 to 5 stars. Am more comfortable using the Apple operating system and the logic they use to drive the machine... The problem with uploading apps disappeared with an OS update, now works seamlessly.  Using it most for Kindle reader or accessing email without having to boot my laptop or desktop PC.  Glad I purchased it....	
436	3	4	0	4	3	2	4	0	4	4	0	0	Sticking by my word. These are overpriced toys. First no support for Flash. This is a huge problem. How can you not support this? Is it being fazed out, yes, but not for a long time. The lack of Flash hurts a lot of the websites I have tried to go to.Next, their new maps support. These maps are terrible. Why kick the company to the curb that has already done all the work, put all the money needed into it, and is proven itself. Why? Apple has gotten a big head again, and believes that whatever it makes it just has to be better.Touch sensitivity: I used my friends iPad 2 for awhile after he upgraded to the iPad 3. He told me I had to try the new version. The touch sensitivity seems to be off. It does not have the response of the iPad 2, Samsung Tab, or even a Kindle I used to have.Retina display failure: I see no difference between the iPad 2 and the new iPad. If you are looking at upgrading to the new one for its display don't. There is nothing special about it. It is just a numbers game.Must use iTunes: iTunes is one of the main reasons I will never own an Apple product. This software is awful. I cannot believe they have not made it easier to use. If you want to buy all your stuff through apple then yes, oh yes they make it easier. But what if you are not brain wasted by apple and you want to use Amazon to get your music for a better price? Not so easy to get it on the iPad. The software is a joke.No support for other video formats. This device unlike all its competitors has said no to supporting standardized formats. If you are buying this device and wanting to transfer your current videos to it, don't. It will only support the apple format.Your apple ID: This is nearly the worst part of the iPad itself. You cannot do anything on the iPad without this ID. It is terrible, and if you forget your security questions you will need a crack team that can get into Fort Knox to get back in. Why are these questions so important? Well it took me over a month to help my mother fully get back into her apple ID because if you upgrade to a new apple product and you do not know those questions? Good Luck! You may never get back in. And if you have spent a lot of money in iTunes it could be lost. BEWARE: write down your security questions.So much for ease of use. I have had in the past year family come up saying with a big smile I just got the iPad. I tell them good luck with that. They go off and "play" with it for awhile. Then they come back and ask how to you download apps, how do you transfer music, how can you put DVD's I already own on it, how can I view this website it says flash not installed, and the list goes on. It took only about a month for one family member to ask me what is this good for then?I then smiled.I stand by my word. It is an overpriced toy.	
437	4	3	3	4	4	0	2	4	4	1	4	4	Newest iPad. I am very pleased with my iPad, the newest model.  The iPad, so far, meets my needs and expectations in every way.  The newest ipad is a replacement for my older one, the earliest model.  I am glad I made the change at this time.

440	4	0	0	4	4	4	4	2	4	0	0	4	price gouge. Where does Amazon get off charging more than Apple for these iPads???  Apple has always kept close tabs on their pricing.  Yeah, Apple already has them at premium price, but usually it's worth it.  However, Apple doesn't price gouge even when there is huge demand.  Why does Amazon feel they need to add to the already high price?  It's not like they put any technology into them.  Obviously it's to make more money from us, the loyal customer.  If you saw an 32 GB iPad 4 priced at $690 in a store you'd walk out and go into an Apple store and get it for $90 cheaper.  You could also get it online from Apple for the true price.  Also, why is the white iPad cheaper than the black iPad?  They're the exact same product, just different color.  Oh, more people want the black one, so Amazon is going to profit more from that.  Shame on Amazon for jacking up the price of an item that people want...in the name of greed.

I had an iPad 2 and I really liked it, but I wanted a better display but was kinda skeptical at first but I am so glad I switched over. Retina display is just beautiful... that said, I didn't notice anything else much different from iPad2 other than the display.	
442	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	2	4	0	4	4	iPad is easy. My iPad is easy to use, easy to recharge, and easy to synch with my iMac.  I just remember that it and my iPod are the 'children of my iMac.  My photos, music, and podcasts are now available in several formats.	
443	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	3	3	4	4	4	Great purchase. The display is incredible. Seems faster than previous versions. I strongly recommend this article to anyone Who has not tried it yet	
444	4	4	3	0	4	4	2	4	1	0	4	4	iPad 3rd gen. Fantastic ! Easy to learn, very fast and love the screen size. Also, tech support was A+. This was my first apple purchase and I am totally happy.	
445	4	4	3	0	4	2	4	3	4	3	3	3	User guide issues. My only comment about all tech things, ie. tablets, smart phones etc. is that the manufacturers assume that the only people who buy these things are the 10 year old to 30 something year old set who were raised on computers and tech gadgets.  The user guide is pretty much worthless to the rest of us.  I haven't been able to even connect the blasted thing properly to my computer thus have been unable to use it.  I was hoping to become more up to date...it seemed the whole world owned a tablet except me.  I know that once I get it all figured out it will be cool...but getting there is the hard part.  Today I go to visit my 14 year old neice...she will get it up and running.  I feel so dumb when it comes to tech stuff...and even dumber when I can't understand the user guide - which by the way is so small it fits into the palm of your hand, meaning that the type needs to be read with a magnifying glass.....and I'm hardly old at 53...or am I?  Again, once it all gets figured out I'm sure I'm going to like it a lot.	
446	3	4	3	4	4	1	4	3	4	4	1	1	Disappointed with my request not satisfied. I have requested to write that the ipad is my daughters 6th birthday gift but when i received it there is no such writing. My daugther was very disappointed and so am I.	
447	0	0	3	3	4	4	2	0	4	4	0	4	There is no such thing as an ipad 3. Bought this product and found out that apple doesnt even make an ipad 3. only ipad2 and the newest version ipad with retina display.lol what a joke their creating there own apple products.	
448	3	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	2	4	0	0	Stickey keys. I bought this iPad for a gift and it looked good when it arrived. I turned it on and it seemed to work fine. When the person I gave it to started using the iPad he discovered that it had a problem called "sticker keys" where the keys randomly act like they're being used, when they aren't. Luckily the iPad was less than a year old and we exchanged it for a new one at the apple store, but I'm very upset that I had to pay so much for a broken iPad! This seller should have either fixed the problem or not sold it to me in the first place.	
449	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	Great job. I recommend this product for everyone. The product arrived at the said date and is of the greatest quality. All pieces came together.	
450	4	4	0	3	4	0	2	4	2	4	3	4	Overall, the Ipad 3 was a great purchase. I was lucky to receive the Ipad 3 as a gift from my dad as a graduation present. His goal was to have me use it for college. It has definitely come in handy already and I am only a freshman. I bring it to class instead of my heavy computer, which, trust me, makes a huge difference when you are also carrying a lot of books. There are many uses of the Ipad 3 in a schooling aspect, and also some restrictions. I'll go into both in this review.I will start with the positives of the Ipad 3. First off, it is super lightweight. So if you are interested in carrying it a lot of places, it is a good option. It is small so it can fit in most bags or purses. I wouldn't write an essay on it, but when I need to look something up really quick in class or on campus, I have the option to. It is also good for taking quick notes on, or having something saved so you can show your professor.Something else that is really good about the Ipad 3 (which also goes for all apple products) is the choices of apps. I am taking a French class, which has an online textbook. However it uses Java, which most Ipad internet apps do not support. Through lots of questions and research, our teacher found out that there is an app that supports java. So now I can also access my french book from my iPad using "Puffin" internet browser. Other than that, safari and other internet apps are very useful, fast, and easy to use.The iPad 3 has a "mail" app that is used for your email. It will load the email straight to your iPad, so you can use the app instead of having to log in online. The best thing about this app is that you can load multiple emails to the app, so you can see all of your emails in one place. This might sound overwhelming, but you can sort them in a specific way. Say you have three emails linked to it, and you only want to see the new emails for two of them, you can select and unselect what email shows the unread messages. Something else that is good for school is "math reference" app.I am so glad I have the Ipad 3 because when I was in math class, and lost in the lecture, I could just open up math reference with my Ipad and get a quick answer. There are many helpful apps on the Ipad 3 that you can use for school, and a lot of them you can get for free, or for really cheap. One comes already on the Ipad 3, which is called "iTunes U". This is an app where you can download and save specifically education material. Such as books, courses, and educational videos. More and more now textbooks for certain courses are coming out with the "kindle edition" of their books. Which means if you have the Ipad, you can buy your textbook as a Kindle book and read it in the kindle app. This would make the books astronomically cheaper and of course, be much more convenient because they would all be in one place in a nice, lightweight iPad 3.The iPad 3 makes it very easy to change settings if necessary. All of the apps are easy to move around into the organization that you desire. They are easy to download, or delete. You can easily manipulate almost every aspect to your Ipad from the "settings" app. It is very clear, concise, and easy to use. Even for the technologically challenge. And even if you don't know how to fix something, you can just look it up online. There are tons of forums and Q&A; websites for apple products. There are also a lot of great shortcuts on the iPad 3 to get around easy. For example, the very left page is a search page. If you double click the home button a bar at the bottom shows up with your most previously visited pages. If the iPad is on lock, if you double click the home button, some options will appear for listening to music (if you already have music playing). If you click and hold the home button, you will have access to "Siri". If you click the home button and lock button at the same time, it will take a screenshot.Now for the negatives of the iPad 3. I have very little things to complain about with this product, but of course there are always a few inconveniences. One would be that sometimes the internet stops working. Most of the time it is just my campus internet failing, but sometimes its my iPad. Most of the time, just turning it off and back on will fix it right up. Very, very rarely my iPad will be slow or have apps quit unexpectedly on me. But again, this is very rare.Overall, the Ipad 3 was a great purchase. I use it everyday. I am still looking for my class books to be kindle editions so I can just download them to my iPad. I am sure more will start having kindle editions soon. It is such a great thing to have for my schooling, it is incredible how many things you can do on it to help your education.	
451	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	2	0	2	4	4	I really love my iPad. I use my iPhone for news video clip, reading books and documents, and surfing the web. I wish a version of MS Office were available for writing and editing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. (The apps available are of mediocre quality).	
452	2	4	3	3	4	3	4	0	4	4	2	4	No es lo que esperaba... Y me refiero a que en ningún lugar de la publicación dice que el iPad es refurbished. Debería exigirse al vendedor publicar esa condición.	
453	3	4	4	3	4	2	0	2	4	1	4	4	Very good. iPad is very good work all the time! And I use continence of link of my iPhone ok! So I use to  usability my web and e-mail ok!	
454	4	4	3	4	4	0	4	1	4	2	4	4	So far enjoying. So far I like it a lot still kind of getting used to using it but hoping that once I get it all figured out it will be perfect	
455	4	4	4	4	3	3	1	0	1	2	4	4	Very good. I was on a tight schedule when I purchased this product, had to select two day shipping and honestly was a bit apprehensive until the product arrived exactly at the expected time. The ipad itself was as good as new and came along with the box and everything. Overall it was a very good deal.	
456	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	Changed my life. Although disappointed when I realized there was actually an Ipad 4, i kept the 3rd generation anyway. No complaints. Love it and use it throughout the day.	
457	4	2	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	0	4	4	Fast! I received this item really fast and in the great condition it was advertised as. Still using it and it works great and was a great price.	
458	0	4	4	0	0	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	As advertised. Just as advertised, everyone in the family wants one now. We will being buying more iPad's soon.Thank you Apple.	
459	4	4	3	4	4	0	0	0	2	0	4	4	I pad. I really like my I pad it met my expectations it is easy to use and to travel with too.	
460	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	2	0	4	2	2	Received a used product. I unfortunately bought this product 2  months before I gave it as a gift. I didn't think I bought 'USED' but that is what I received. The product works well but it was embarrassing when my niece turned on the Ipad and there were 350 contacts, previous owner's inbox was full, face time account existing, etc... I truly wanted to return it but my niece says that it works and she's afraid that if I asked for replacement that she wouldn't get it on time before she leaves for Europe.	
461	3	0	4	0	4	2	0	4	4	3	2	0	I loved it until it stopped charging properly. I loved it until it stopped charging properly.  Just too much money for it to stop charging and making the Adapter so hot that it burns you when you touch it!  Even after changing the charger five times same thing!  "Not Charging" messaging showing after awhile!  Just sporadic charging!!!  Very frustrating!  Only after a couple of weeks!	
462	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	0	4	4	4	Great and more space for itune downloads. The touch Screen is clear and colors are bright with no issue of any hick ups or stalling.Easy to download applications where eve your can find a wifi connection and its light weight and easy to move around with.	
463	4	3	4	4	3	4	0	2	1	3	4	4	Love it. Better than I expected.  I find I use it more and more each day.  Very easy to use and long battery life.	
464	3	4	4	3	3	3	4	1	4	1	3	3	It is a very user friendly device. The only reason that I gave it a 4 star, is because being accostumed to the Windows environment I like flexibility and expandability.  The only way you can put more memory in this thing is by buying a more expensive model, really?	
465	3	4	4	4	4	0	2	3	1	3	4	4	I love my iPad! I got this for the whole family to share.  Everyone likes it and we haven't had any problems with it.  Out of the box I had to update some software which took about 20 minutes.  I use it for emails,an e-reader, and for watching movies/tv.  My kids use it for games, e-reader, and watching educational shows.  I was worried that the App Store would only have paid apps, but I was surprised they had some great free ones.  There were free classic books too.  I went out and bought a case for it to, but only for my own sanity since the kids were going to be using it.	
466	4	3	0	4	4	4	3	0	2	4	4	4	Awesome! Replacement for stolen gen 2 ipad. That retina display is nice, but I really don't notice it too much as I'm not a 'videophile.'	
467	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	3	1	1	4	4	GPS very good. Got this unit to take in place of laptop on road trips. It is much easier to see in cities when mounted on dash of truck or wife is acting as navigator,while I watch the road and traffic. Also use to check email and find local places to visit.	
468	4	4	4	3	4	2	2	0	4	0	4	4	A superb communication device. This is my first iPad.  It is an amazing communication device.  Am also using it to brush up on my Spanish.	
469	3	4	4	4	2	3	1	4	0	2	3	3	Very nice used product. Very good shape, works great and connects wifi very easily and quickly. This item does however charge very slowly weather it's plugged into USB or wall charger. I don't know if that is the nature of this beast or not as my son'd is the next gen up from this and his charges rather quickly. Overall, very good product, very good packaging and very good seller.	
470	4	2	2	4	4	0	4	2	4	4	3	3	Good machine.... Despite slow in showing the photos, the machine is efficient.  Good enough for work applications.  Long life battery too, I only charge every 2-3 days.	
471	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	4	3	0	0	Seller advertised iPad as new- 1 Year Warranty expired  3 months ago. Cellular Data stopped working. After numerous attempts to solve with ATT finally brought it into an Apple Store.Apple Tech informed me it was hardware issue and would have to be replaced. No problem, I just got this 3 months ago, iPads have a 1 year limited warrantyTurns out the warranty EXPIRED June 1st 2013., 2 months before I bought it, and the seller completely failed to include that very important bit of information.Nice.	
472	4	4	4	4	3	4	1	0	4	1	4	4	My favorite. Love love love!!! I have a desk top computer, laptop and a Kindle.  This IPad is my favorite!! I use it all the time	
473	3	3	4	3	3	4	0	4	4	4	3	3	Happy with iPad. This is our first iPad. The new Air is 3 or 4 hundred dollars more than this one was. I think this one is very good buy for the money.	
474	4	3	0	3	4	4	0	1	4	1	4	4	iPad equals perfect. My iPad was on time brand-new and it works perfectly.  I am glad that I ordered from Amazon.com instead of going into a store	
475	4	4	0	4	3	4	0	1	3	1	4	4	I love it! So much faster than my iPad one.  A bit sharper as well. I have three and I go to this one first even though I bought it for my wife.  She is not very techie and doesn't use it as much as she did after she got it.	
476	4	4	3	4	0	4	2	0	4	4	4	4	2nd iPad. Bought to replace my daughters older 1st Generation iPad as certain features could not be updated. She loves this new one with it's new features and a camera. She goes nowhere without it.	
477	4	3	4	4	4	3	2	1	2	1	4	4	Great purchase! Item as described, in perfect condition! Easy to use, allows me to get a lot done, as well as catch up on my shows using the Netflix app, and other social media.	
478	2	4	4	3	0	4	3	3	3	4	2	4	A little disappointed .... The 'scratches' mentioned in the description were cracks but works great. The price reflected the condition but the truth would've been less of a surprise.	
479	3	4	4	4	4	0	2	1	4	4	4	4	Lightweight Portability! Since purchasing my Ipad I have realized how much portability I now have when it comes to computing.  Living in a technology-driven world requires continual access to computers, but it is great to be able to have a device that goes with me easily.  In my position as a high school administrator, I use the Ipad on a daily basis to conduct and write classroom observations, track students, look up information on the go, and check and schedule meetings and appointments.  I can do all of this without having to be "chained" to my office desktop computer.  I can be visible throughout the school rather than being the "man in the office".  The Ipad does everything I need and more.  When I have time to myself, I can read my favorite authors' works, play a game or two, and even order pizza when I get hungry.  What more do I need?	
480	4	4	4	4	4	1	1	4	4	4	4	4	I am glad I purchased this item. I got my money worth with this used Ipad, 3rd generation.We all love it at home. It was a good pick.	
481	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	2	4	4	great product. I am please with this purchase, it was ship as described and looks great. thanks for a great product! Five-star	
482	3	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	0	4	4	Best iPad. I received this on time and it has been a great purchase. I love it. Great for reading graphic novels. Watching videos. Typing is not the best; though they have external devices for that.I think iPad 3 is one of the best iPads out there for the money.	
483	4	3	4	3	4	0	4	4	1	4	3	4	Decent upgrade from the iPad2; some compromise. I love my iPad 2. The weight and size was about the max that I thought I could withstand in a handheld device.  For me, the iPad 3 is a set of compromises that I decided was worth it in the end.Weight/thickness: If you hold your iPad a lot when using it, then I think you will notice the extra heft of the third gen iPad.  It's not major, but it's noticeable. I find that I become a fatigued more quickly when reading in bed or holding the iPad on the plan while watching a movie, etc.Heat:  Yes, it runs a lot warmer than my iPad 2.  You will notice it.  The heat adds to the overall fatigue, largely because the greatest heat occurs exactly where you hold the iPad in portrait mode (lower left corner). Sure would have been nice if they cold have flipped something around inside to put the greatest heat elsewhere.Screen:  Nice improvement over the iPad2.  Makes reading easier on the eyes.  No more jagged fonts. When I go back to reading on my iPad 2, I wonder how in the word I managed with it.  Colors are more vibrant too.  I won't call is revolutionary, but it is a very nice upgrade.  At the end of the day, my iPad 2 would still be fine if I had never seen the iPad 3 screen.LTE:  This is a major selling point for me.  AT&T; LTE has been faster than both my home and work WiFi.  I did notice that LTE drains the battery very quickly, however.  I saw a 10% drop in battery within about 15 minutes while using LTE.  Battery drain was much slower when I jumped onto my work wifi.Overall:  I am happy with the new iPad, but I do find that I miss the smaller size and weight of the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 "disappears" when you use it, which was Steve Job's main objectives.  The iPad 3 does not have the same effect.  The screen pulls you in, but the extra heft becomes apparent more quickly.  IF the heft doesn't become noticeable, the heat will get your attention.  The heat is within acceptable limits, but it is there to remind you that you are holding an electronic device.  It's harder to get lost in that book or movie.  So if the magic of the iPad disappearing is important to you, then wait for the fourth gen which is bound to be lighter and cooler.  If you want a graphics and LTE workhorse that you will use on a table more than holding free-form in your hand, then the iPad 3 is a good choice.  Overall, I prefer the iPad 2 for the reason that it does disappear and pull you in.  Already waiting to see if the iPad 4 returns to this experience.	
484	0	0	4	3	3	0	1	1	4	0	0	4	Good way of wasting money. First of all I want to point out that I own an Ipad (first edition) and Ipad2. I need a tablet primarily to work with e-mail, read and listen to the news (cnbc and others), watch movies and listen to the music on the go. And if a product is well made and of good quality I'm not going to buy something else just because it is NEW, but actually doesn't offer substantially better experience. Not only new Ipad doesn't offer something that would made it different from previous models (for example possibility of installing  windows , or Adobe Flash etc.), but I have serious doubts about its quality. Based on my previous experience the quality of first Ipad is not that good ( It worked well for almost 2 years, but then one day just died), and I doubt that Ipad 3 quality is any better. I am most certainly not going to be buying a tablet that has 2 years life period (and who knows maybe even less). And it really pisses me off that a lot of times instead of graphics and charts you see empty space or you cannot listen to an interview. In my opinion right now Apple is making money on a smart marketing strategy, but not on an innovative product.	
485	3	4	2	3	4	4	2	4	4	3	2	4	May be it is great for Mac oriented people. I found no new serious features in this product.From my side Android is a more convenient OS, so I am still using Samsung Galaxy Tab... Device is passed to my friend.	
486	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	1	4	4	Great at what it is intended to do. If you like reading books, watching TV shows or Movies, and playing games, then this device is perfect. However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about. I've rarely had difficulty finding a hot spot at any destination I've travelled to.	
487	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	0	4	2	0	0	Frustrations with apple. I have an iPad 3, and several Mac computers. I really wish apple would answer the phone when I try to contact support. I only use the phone after exhaustive attempts to use the website support.	
488	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	3	0	4	4	Good. This product is very Good I suggest you to buy it!!!  I really like itIt came on time and it is exactly like the picture	
489	4	4	3	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	My new IPad. Wow! That was fast!It works, it really works! I'm amazed at how intuitive it is. I'm what is politely (impolitely) known as an old codger, yet after having it for 2 hours I'm sailing through it and thinking of more and more things I can do with it. Grocery lists, to do lists, books I want to read, appointments,take it on trips to check out hotels, restaurants, things to see; check the weather, road conditions, have email with me at all times...Before I ordered it I borrowed "iPad the missing manual" by J D Biersdorfer from the public library - great help.So far I'm very very happy with my purchase and grinning from ear to ear.	
490	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	2	0	4	2	3	It's just ok. It's tough to provide a review for me, as the product rates a 5 for it's intended purpose - but that's mostly do to a great app and not so much the iPad itself.We are an Android family and have the latest Galaxy phones, plus a Transformer Prime tablet and even a Samsung Slate (Win 7 tablet).  The iPad really just feels "off" - like it's missing something.  The OS isn't customizable, and we really miss a back button like on Android.  Not all of the apps have buttons in the same places and very little consistency, so it was a bit of annoyance just using it for daily use.If we needed this for daily/entertainment use, I would probably return it.  As it turns out, I'm a pilot and use it for Foreflight/Stratus.  For that purpose it's fantastic, but that's because Foreflight is awesome, and could be just as awesome on Android.  So the iPad doesn't deserve all the credit - but maybe some.My girlfriend loaded her Danish newspaper website, and it didn't display well at all, everything was a mess and all the flash elements were obviously broken.  The same site loads perfectly, flash and all, on the Transformer tablet.This is my first experience with iOS and it just feels really dumbed down and overly simplistic, but in a bad way.  Missing flash is a very real problem and I kind of think anyone honest with themselves would freely admit that Android is far superior at this time.The battery life is fantastic and will last for a couple days of flying without a recharge, that's a big bonus.  The screen is quite nice though the benefits with the retina display just aren't all that noticeable in the real world.  Does it look nice?  Totally.The iPad is a very well polished device, but it's trying too hard to be simplistic to the point where it becomes more of a toy for a 5 year old child than a device for an adult.  I highly recommend Android over the iPad, and for me, I prefer my Win 7 Slate - I need a real OS.	
491	3	4	4	3	4	0	1	4	3	0	4	4	Love it! I love the new iPad.  I bought the Kindle app for it and have already read several books on it.  I also use my new IPad for the internet, email, and other apps. It's great and now that I have it, I can't imagine not having one!	
492	2	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	2	2	Good iPad, touchy headphones jack... I recently got an iPad 3 wifi and I've liked it except for the headphones jack.  I am having a weird problem with my Echo headphones in that it works on everything, iPad 3G, computers (windows and mac), and everything else except the iPad. I went to Apple and it turns out that it's a specific iPad wifi model problem but they won't do anything since it is only my pair of headphones! But they work on everything else! It's so stupid that the 3G models have an upgraded headphone jack that will work with ANY headphones, including mine.  I might have bought that model if I knew that! Now i have to get another pair of headphones just for the iPad, which is ridiculous! Still a good tablet though!

494	3	3	4	4	3	4	3	2	0	0	3	4	The new Ipad 3. I have had the new Ipad for almost 3 weeks now. I've downloaded lots of apps, use it for business meetings, play HD games on it, take pictures in different settings, use it to stream videos, watch my own videos on it, do some ppt presentations on it, use MSWord and Excell documents on it, read some iBooks on it, put the battery into constant abuse to see how long it last and I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty much impressed! But I do have a few cons about this tablet. And now I will list my pros and cons below.PROS & CONS:1.  Retina display is stunning! I have view wallpapers, photos, videos(my own uploaded & streaming)and it looks incredibly sharp and crisp.  I have some photos that were taken during a trip to SF Bay a few months back and forgot to bring my Cannon DSLR camera so we took some pictures with my wife's little samsung handheld 8mp camera.  When these photos loaded onto my laptop they look ugly, blurry, and pixelated but when I had them transfer to the new Ipad to view...wow they look great (not amazing, but great). The retina display help the photos to shine!  I've also uploaded the movie "The Lorax and Acts of Valor" to the new Ipad and even at 720p, the pictures looks stunning.  Then I stream movies from Netflix and Amazon and the pictures looks even more stunning.  Last week we went to a hiking trip and I took some pictures with the Ipad's camera.  I was a little skeptical due to the fact that it didn't have a built in flash, but when I view the pictures both on the new Ipad and my laptop, I was amazed how good the pictures look (it makes me wanted to take it to walmart and have it printed).  I even test the display laying down and try viewing from the side and the picture still looks stunning.  Overall, the Retina display on the new Ipad is topnotch and you will love it! Definately a PRO!2.  Performance wise, the Ipad is a quard core (4X) processor and with only 1g of internal graphics memory I don't really have much issues with it.  I have had a few crashes with some apps but I believe it's due to the app.  I have run apps that are processor hungry such as Air Supremacy and Garageband without a glitch.  I know with any tablet, you will experience some problems and the Ipad 3 is no exception.  I only wish apple put a 6 cores and 2g of memory inside but that would up the price too. Neither PRO or CON.3.  Responsiveness, the touch screen response pretty quick with my fingers but I'm using a stylus pen and depends on how hard the tip of your stylus pen is sometimes the screen won't register.  You will need to push a little harder. Still a PRO!4.  Productivity, with any tablet you buy it because you want it to use it for work and play, right?  Well, I have work with the new Ipad and play with it and this is how I feel.  I've used it to take notes during a meeting (I'm the notetaker) using just the app "Note" with a bluetooth keyboard and I was able to keep up with the meeting.  Pretty impressive! I have use it to give out speeches using ppt slideshow and able to use and edit MSWord on the tablet.  Even if I have to use third party apps to be able to use ppt and words, it runs great and very impressive!  I've used the tablet to remote controll my laptop and wow it runs smoothly without a glitch.  I was able to download some of the files I needed to my new Ipad within minutes!  You can access ONLive, Dropbox, etc. on the tablet without any issues.  Reading on the new Ipad is great also.  The letters on the screen is truly crisp, clear and sharp and I gotta say it's the best compare to any tablet on the market now (Even with the new Asus Infinety TF700).  PLAYTIME! Games, Games and Games!  I've downloaded tons of games, bowling, Angry birds, hockey, fruit ninja, pool, DH reloaded, Riptide, Dark Me, FLcommando, Dead Trigger, Juggernaut, GT HD, Air Supremacy, Metalstorm, F18 Carrier, Gunships, Blood and Glory, Infinety blade, and many more that I've played and deleted.  The games looks stunning on the new Ipad and it plays well (especially Air Supremacy, wow you gotta check out the graphics on that game!). THIS IS MOST DEFINATELY A PRO!5.  Well, every tablet has it goods and bads and it's no exception for Apple's new Ipad.  I have the screen brightness at "AUTO" and in my opinion I don't think the battery lasted long enough. It lasted about 6.5 to 7 hours for me.  This made me want to get the Asus Infinety TF700 with the keyboard dock.  I went to bestbuy to ask them why didn't the new Ipad support flash and they gave me a bunch of bullship excuses.  Well it's APPLE! They want to be different!  I really wish that my wallpapers could be a moving background like all the android tablets.  NO ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS - a bummer for me!  NO microSD card slots, HDMI, or anything else except your power button, wake, and volume buttons.  And it will cost me an arm and a leg to get accessories/adapters for the new Ipad to be able to stream (HDMI) movies to my HD TV, shoot my ppt presentation on a screen, transfer photos/videos to and from my new Ipad.  And most of all, I can not expand my internal storage cuz NO microSD card!  I bought (well...my wife bought it for me.  What a nice wife I have!) the 32g Ipad and with all the apps, movies, videos, photos I have already I'm down to 7g of memory left.  Darn! should have told her that I wanted the 64g!6.  Other CONS that I have are, IT GETS HOT! as hot as my 3 year old laptop.  The new Ipad can be a heater for winter (although the new Ipad might freeze during winter).  Do not put your Ipad in the car!  It does not like heat!  Even under the seat it will overheat, it likes to breath just like you and me.  It's like why would you lock your animal or kids in a warm summer car.  Same concepts here people! why would you lock your Ipad in a hot summer car.  When you play intense games or run application hungry apps it will get hot and you will notice it.  Another gripe, I mean CON.  What $#R@# is the use of a facing camera that takes pictures or video that looks like VHS quality.  All these tablet companies that have a little wimpy low resolution facing camera on their tablet need to go and do more research.  If you're willing to put a 8MP camera on the back might as well put one in the front.  I want to look stunning when I facetime with friends and family.  It's an advertisement gig! LOOK GOOD on camera to show the world they will come and buy your product!  PUT a decent camera on the front!7. And LAST but not LEAST!  I was very happy that the next system upgrade on the new Ipad, Apple will finally have SIRI on the new Ipad.  Well...at least I will have a woman to talk to when my wife is not home.  I just hope Apple don't use a man instead! better yet, give options to choose man or woman or an alien.  I guess, after all the PROS and CONS and gripes it all comes down to one last question.  DO I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THE NEW IPAD 3?  Yeah...yeah! If you have the cash ($499 and up) or if you have a beautiful and very nice wife that would buy one for you.  " GO AHEAD MAKE YOUR DAY! YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED! "	
495	3	3	4	4	3	1	0	3	4	4	4	4	PROTECT YOUR IPAD... The new iPad is certainly a step ahead of any of it's competitors right now.  I have owned one since June and have used it almost every single day since I have gotten it.  If you take anything from this  review it is that you should invest in protecting your iPad.  I use the Zagg Invisible Shield HD and the STM Grip Case (i have reviewed both).Pros:-Portability allows you to always take it with you-Ridiculously Long Battery Life.  Apple boasts a 10 hour battery life and with brightness adjustment it could certainly last longer.-Retina Display (HD videos and apps are stunning)-Front and back Camera great for Skyping/Photos-Smart cover saves the sleep button from overuse/malfunction-Speak to type feature is there but more of a novelty feature-Great for notetaking/school-New Apps released often including free apps-Many many shortcuts make it stand out such as a quick mute feature-Notification bar is great a great way to receive facebook messages/twitter mentions*Siri to be released soon exclusively on the new iPad.*iCloud feature that I have not used at all do to slow internetCons:-Apple's touch screen keyboard is awkward and the biggest complaint i have (Docked or Split).-The built in speaker is okay but could be louder in my opinion-If overused the battery section of the iPad can be hot to the touch (can be negated with case).-May end up spending a lot on pricey apps (225,000 in App Store) so look into jailbreaking-Rear Camera is high quality but front camera not so much-Can promote carpal tunnel syndrome (Stylus can help)-No USB or SD Card slot-Limited to Skyfire Browser's Flash capabilitiesFavorite Apps by Category:Game Apps:-DreamLeague (Soccer app)-Peggle HD-Words With Friends HD-Fruit Ninja HDSocial Apps:-Facebook-Twitter-SkypeBrowsers:-Skyfire Browser (For Flash Videos)-Safari is my go to browser otherwise-Have heard Chrome is fast but have not tried itStreaming Apps:-Netflix-Amazon Instant Video-WatchESPNMiscellaneous Apps:-Alien Blue (Reddit)-Notability (Taking Notes with a stylus)-iBooks (Reading books you can get for free off the internet ;) )Lastly, SHORTCUTS.  The new iPad has many shortcuts such as swiping with 4 fingers to switch between apps or quickly adjust brightness.  Look into all the shortcuts that the new iPad features so you do not have to slowly learn them on your own like i did.****If you have any questions or comments i would love to hear it****	
496	3	4	3	4	3	4	0	0	2	0	4	4	1080p support is worth the upgrade. I have been extremely happy with my purchase of the iPad 3. I have a lot of movies on my home server in 1080p and with the help of third party apps, they play brilliantly. My partner has never liked his iPhone 4 because it is too small, but I have to literally take the iPad from him. I also have not used my desktop since receiving this thing. My desktop is an awesome $4500.00 dual loop liquid cooled customized beast. Lately it has just been sitting there.I think I see another iPad 3 in our future. I hope they don't go up too much higher before we get another one.	
497	3	3	2	4	3	2	0	4	4	3	4	4	BEST CREATIVE PRODUCT IN A LONG TIME!!! So in short, because this may be a long review, get the iPad 3 with the Retina display.  Awesome, Awesome piece of technology and tool.Now for the long version.  I had an iPhone for two years before purchasing the iPad.  I had played around with my friends when the first one came out and thought it was a fun (expensive) toy great for surfing, playing music and games.When I got the chance to get one for myself finally, I honestly wasn't sure that I would use it.  I had been given the first gen Kindle Fire and thought the UI was s#@t!  Not to mention that the Android store was neutered and I wasn't able to download any app that I wanted because of the Amazon operating system that was on it.  So even after rooting the Kindle and installing the Android operating system I was even less thrilled about the tablet idea.  The touch technology between my iPhone and Kindle were significantly different.  That difference equated to annoyance when I couldn't get the Kindle to recognize the correct link I was trying to get without having to zoom in all the time.  The iPhone would figure out what letter I was picking on a page and get it right 98% of the time... unzoomed.  What I did like was the idea of being able to not have to have my laptop around all the time (which is 17inches of screen) and that I could use it as a reader.However, I didn't want to squander my work bonus on something that would sit on the kitchen counter next to the Kindle Fire because I had no use for it.  After researching what apps were available like iWorks, Flipbook,  Note Taker HD that would serve a utilitarian purpose for my job.  I went ahead and got the iPad.  I honestly can't remember being more stoked about Apple since my first experience on the Apple IIe as a kid learning basic and playing games.  This muthafkr goes EVERYWHERE with me now along with my iPhone in my back pocket LOL!!!The clarity, visual smoothness, quality of the metal... Steve and his team really out did themselves.  As a reader, there can occasionally be some glare as I've come across when reading outside.  For a true person wanting an eReader, I think one of the other Kindles would work (Kindle Fire had glare too).  However, very few come close to the experience of the iPad... and the total solution architecture experience that Apple has created for and around their products.It is art, design, and technology merged.	
498	1	4	4	3	2	3	4	3	4	0	4	4	Love it. Worth the price does almost everything my pc does even faster.lots of cool stuff still finding out.my first apple product never by anything else again.Apple iPad MC705LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, Black) NEWEST MODEL	
499	3	0	3	3	3	4	0	0	2	4	0	0	Beware of Worldwide Distributors. Some 3rd party sellers such as Worldwide Distributors are less than reputable and provide unusable products.  Ipad freezes and WWD has refused to replace.	
500	4	3	4	4	4	3	0	0	2	4	3	3	Very good notebook. Interface with printer kinda clunky.  Good display except for direct sunlight.  Good battery life.  Fast access to internet and overall ease of use. I'd probably buy my next version with the 3G to have additional flexibility.	
501	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	3	0	4	4	super transaction. My i-pad was as discribed and it was shipped extremely fast.  It is worth the price. Easy to set up especially if you have an i-phone.	
502	4	4	3	3	3	3	0	1	0	4	4	4	My iPad makes me! It was just the tablet I expected. And as a matter of fact I'm reviewing this item right from the tablet I purchased. No scratches, no defects whatsoever. I needed the tablet for my course work. I spend a lot of time outside my room and need to read while I'm out. It is serving the purpose for which it was bought and that makes me satisfied.	
503	3	3	3	4	4	4	0	3	4	4	4	4	Have tried other tablets - iPad still the best. We were against buying an iPad because of the cost and seemingly "blind" following of all things Apple.  We both have iPhones, but only because my husband's company pays for our cell phone plan (though we are happy with those).  Living in Austin, TX, all we hear about is Apple products because of their offices here.My family purchased us an Asus Tablet that works with the Andorid platform, so we were happy with the apps and overall use.  I used it mostly for reading Kindle books, and he used it for reading the news.  My company bought all of its employees iPads this past fall, and we simply fell in love with it...to the point we were having problems sharing it.  The browsing speed is so much faster, and we can stream videos for hours without the battery losing even 50% of its capacity.  It is also nice to sync it with our email accounts and iTunes, and it was easier to respond to emails using the iPad versus the Asus.  We also enjoyed taking pictures with it.  iPhones take better quality pictures, but the iPad works fine for still images and decent lighting.  Taking video is also easy, and we can text message pics and links between out iPad and other cell phones.About 6 weeks later, I bought this iPad (which was a great deal compared to buying it in the store).  While I use my iPad for email, Twitter, Facebook, Skype, and watching shows on Hulu and Netflix, my husband uses his all the time for browsing the news and streaming videos.  The apps are limitless, and the computing speed is so fast.This is great for anyone with existing Apple products or the person who has nothing Apple related.  We were disbelievers, and now we understand what all the hype is about.  You won't find us standing in line for the next release, but we wouldn't rule out buying another one some day.  We are fiscally responsible people, and I doubted spending the money...but it was worth it!	
504	4	3	4	4	3	1	3	4	2	2	4	4	Great purchase. The display is incredible. Seems faster than previous versions. I strongly recommend this article to anyone Who has not tried it yet	
505	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	1	4	4	3	3	Good choice. There are a lot of  interesting apps helping me explore the world around. But setting up is a little bit time consuming and sometime confusing.	
506	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	2	4	4	ipad 3rd generation. Love this, we currently have 3 in our household, everyone wants their own.  Makes me want to trade in my android for iPhone.	
507	3	3	3	2	4	0	3	4	0	1	3	3	The iPad is GREAT, but.... The product is great but has a critical flaw. If the iPad was compatible with Adobe Flash then I would give the product 5 stars.	
508	4	4	4	3	4	0	4	3	4	4	4	4	good seller. this I pad was great out of the box pluged it in charged it up read the book and i was off on the road to internet	
509	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	0	4	Es un engaño ofrecen un producto y envían otro similar. No llego a tiempo y lo peor fue que me enviaron un producto usado. pague por un iPad 3rd generation nuevo me enviaron un iPad 2rd generation usado es una falta de respeto era el regalo para mi hija no me enviaron el producto que me ofrecieron	
510	3	3	1	4	3	4	2	4	4	1	3	3	Not much different. The product is good -slim enough etc. but I don't see much difference compared to earlier models -I still have the old generation	
511	4	0	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	Changed my life. Although disappointed when I realized there was actually an Ipad 4, i kept the 3rd generation anyway. No complaints. Love it and use it throughout the day.	
512	3	4	4	3	3	0	4	1	1	4	4	4	Love the iPad 3. I really enjoy the white iPad. Siri and the new retina display are great! It is worth the money if you are considering between an Ipad 2 and Ipad 3.	
513	0	4	4	4	4	3	1	1	4	0	0	4	Best buy has it for 314.00 brand new. They removed my comment earlier for informing the public so just got to best buy and you will get a better deal.	
514	3	3	3	3	3	1	2	4	0	4	4	4	It's Fun!!!! The iPad is like having a computer in your hands without the mouse and no click and drag!!!  You will love it, wish I could afford two son I don't have to share!!!	
515	3	3	3	3	4	4	1	3	0	4	4	4	LOVE MY IPAD. Love it!  Big enough to read and small enough to carry in my purse. Great for my granddaughter at the restaurant. Keeps her busy.	
516	2	4	3	4	3	4	3	4	4	1	4	4	Awesome. It's an iPad with retina display. Nothing more needs to be said. I use it everyday, no issues whatsoever. Battery life is awesome, speed is amazing.	
517	0	1	1	4	0	2	4	4	3	4	0	0	advertised as new. This was advertised as a new product and arrived sealed - even with the tear off film on the screen.  However, upon opening found another persons email address, personal contacts, pictures, etc.  I had to go to the trouble of finding someone to help me default all of this as if direct from the manufacuturer.  When paying this much for an item I expect it to be as advertised.  Beware of this seller!!  I gave 1 star because I do hate being lied to!!	
518	4	3	3	4	4	3	4	0	0	4	4	4	First I-Pad I have owned.  Seems Great to Me! I really don't have anything to compare this to.  Thought it would be more of a novelty item really since I have a computer, but I do find I am using it more and more because it is convenient to pick up and search the web for something, or play a game, watch a movie, play music.  Haven't had a bit a problem really except getting dropped from my wireless connection.  Seems if I reboot my modem that usually solves the problem for a while	
519	3	4	3	3	4	0	2	1	4	0	4	4	I bought it for a sheet music library. I bought the iPad for a sheet music library after seeing someone else using one that way.  I use it while playing and that big file box of music does not get lugged around.  I am using the iPad for more that, but for its intended purpose I am very satisfied.	
520	4	3	4	4	3	0	2	1	2	3	3	3	Good product, good deal. This is a good product and a very good deal, but I must say that the battery life is somewhat shorter than I expected. That being said, it is still worth the price and for non extreme gamers or heavy database app users the iPad 3 is an excellent deal compared to the version 4 for the money. For those without the need for a faster CPU, I would shop for an available version 3.	
521	3	4	3	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	4	4	Why did they stop production of this item so fast? So I've heard they stopped making the ipad 3 within the first year of its release in attempts to release the ipad 4 and make more money which is just horrible because I absolutely love my ipad 3. I wish they didn't just stop producing it so fast and am happy to have gotten one before they did.	
522	0	4	4	1	4	1	1	1	1	4	1	1	False advertisement. When I ordered this Ipad it was advertised as the newest model when in fact this was a third generation.  The price I paid for this ipad was the cost of the newest model at the time and the 3rd generations were selling for $100.00 less in all retail stores.  Be very cautious with this seller and inspect any order and do not wait to return.	
523	3	3	3	4	2	4	4	0	4	3	4	4	I love it. I use this item for everything.  APple is great, the device is sturdy and as expected.  I have no complaints.

531	3	3	4	3	3	4	1	0	3	1	4	4	Good Tablet. Most people know that the iPad tablet is the best tablet out on the tech market today.  This tablet was a purchase for my brother, and he loves it, as much as I do mine, it arrived before expected date, and I most definitely would recommend this iPad to anyone, and I'm like a walking testimony, I cannot say any thing bad about the iPad , and  we are very pleased.	
532	3	0	4	4	4	4	3	0	2	2	4	4	Apple iPad 3rd generation. Love it-- one of the best purchases that I've ever made.  I've had no regrets even with never versions of the iPad being released.  Mine was the last version that used the 30 pt connector instead of the lightning connector.  Use it every day for email, apps, web surfing and connecting to a Google Drive.	
533	3	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	0	3	3	3	Happy with iPad. This is our first iPad. The new Air is 3 or 4 hundred dollars more than this one was. I think this one is very good buy for the money.

536	4	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	1	4	4	4	Satisfied. Considering this was refurbished, I'm happy with product.  After all, I realistically couldn't expect brand new but it works as good.	
537	4	4	4	2	0	4	4	3	2	2	3	4	Great hardware and iOS, horrible life cycle, will never buy again. This was my first and last Apple product. It works wonderfully, the screen is beautiful and the apps perform almost flawlessly. What I dislike was 97 days after I bought it they came out with a new model that made mine obsolete instantly. Seven months later the same thing happened and now mine was 2  generations old in les than 10 months. I am not against implementing new advances but Apple knew way before I bought mine that I was buying something that would be obsolete in 11 months and they sold it to me at full price. I can hear their CFO saying: 'another sucker we took money from with an obsolete product sold as if it was the top of the line'. I expect better of the companies I buy expensive hardware from, that if they know what is going to happen just start discounting the current - but soon to be obsolete product -  so the CUSTOMERS would stay loyal. They had me and they lost me. Good luck to them with their bait and switch way of doing business.	
538	3	3	4	3	4	4	0	1	0	3	3	4	Ipad. This is crazy that i love it very much. I like to see this type of good second hand. But nowadays people criticize bad quality on used iPad sold by the 3rd party thru Amazon. So they keep telling the bad iPad sold by amazon website. They are afraid to deal with amazon products especially with the iPad. So you guys must give attention on the good second hand sellers first of all to check them the items it is worth to sent or not. Because of one problem occurs, your names will be affected!!!	
539	3	3	4	4	2	0	1	0	4	4	3	4	The only option for aviation apps. I bought my iPad 3 for using aviation apps in my airplane. The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.

542	3	4	2	4	3	3	0	1	2	4	4	4	second hand version bought and is as expected. ipad was packaged very well and arrived looking like new. very few minor scratches from usage. screen like new, works perfectly and battery holds charge very well.It is not using lighting jack (not the latest version), but still works extremely well.Worth every penny and would buy it second hand again.	
543	3	4	3	4	3	3	0	4	1	4	2	2	Review from a current Android user.  It's a toss up, the apple "may" go. I've been using an Acer A400 for about a year, and to be honest, with the firmware and software updates it has become a very stable and fun tablet.  It does absolutely everything I need.  I love having the built in full size USB port, MicroSD card and true dolby stereo speakers.  So you are probably asking, why did you buy an Ipad then.I wanted to check out some new technology and I already know Apple makes some great products for graphic/audio and Education.  Well I like the interface and ability to truly close out programs.  But you know what?  The Apple bogs down when truly multitasking.  The android puts apps in a suspended state, so you can have dozens of apps open.  Android "claims" it is ok, but the performance does start to hurt.  The iPad simply gets hot and bogs down if you do the same things.The iPad has a better and more solid feel, it is a snappier interface, but it is locked down.  The Android is semi-locked down, but easy to change.  You don't have to have a face full of icons.If I had to start over again, I wouldn't buy either at this date and time.  I honestly  believe that there are some very good products based on Windows 8 and later versions of Android that will hit the market in Q3.  This will be a game changer as far as functionality and usefulness of a tablet.My advice.  Put your credit card back in your wallet unless you have an immediate need for a tablet.  Don't fall for either an Android or iPad at this particular time.  They are all over priced and the limitations are frustrating.  Go take a walk and think about the fact that you can save the money for a much more advanced generation of tablet about to hit the market 3 to 6 months down the road.I rate this a HOLD.	
544	3	4	4	4	2	4	0	3	4	0	4	4	From an original iPad 1 owner. I had the original iPad, but when the iPad2 came out, the "improvements" we're not enough to justify the change. I am so glad I held for the 3rd gen. This really is a change. Great cameras that take very good pictures  and videos. But to travel, I got the Samsung Galaxy 8.9". Awesome travelling tablet, and the pad stays at home.	
545	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	Waited to enter 2 centavos... I am coming from an original ipad. For the first six months I barely used that thing, rarely engaged the 3g service. Then one day I used it to study new engineering texts... Then started to read science articles while outside the house, and write emails to collegues during downtime. I am now addicted like a twelve year old girl. I bought a red alligator Piel Frama case so notice no heat, nor heaviness... But I do feel that less battery life for a lighter unit would suit me. Bottom line, it does no more than the original except I do use the camera, enjoy the clear text, notice less lag and much quicker stutter-free play. I sold my old unit and would NEVER ever ever complain about the blazing 4g speed with which I can play and enjoy the internet on the move. A few hundred dollars difference for somthing I use hours a day is super cheap, like pennies an hour. Trouble free, pretty, effortless to use, and the cost of half a day at Vegas : ) ... Five stars for a product that simply works better than I need it to for EVERYTHiNG... let the haters hate... I am content, and to old men that is love...	
546	3	2	4	4	2	1	4	0	3	0	1	4	Wish I never bought it. The iPad is a really cool device... when it works, and if you are a dedicated MAC person. If you are not, your experience is likely to be incredibly frustrating.  First of all, having spent an enormous amount of money, not getting a manual is unbelievable. But wait, that's why they want to charge you $99 for a year's worth of customer service, or a smaller sum just to answer a single question!!!  The original I bought didn't work and I had to return it.  Thank God at least the brief warranty was still effective.  I had always heard MACs were reliable and PCs weren't.  Wrong!!!  I have used MACs before and never understood the buzz.  The iPad is neat, but it is buggy as hell and I have problems with it every few months.  My PC is quite old and needs to be replaced, I am not even tempted to buy an Apple product, they remind me of old Jaguar XKE's look great, but spend way too much time in the shop!	
547	2	4	1	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	2	2	Good iPad, touchy headphones jack... I recently got an iPad 3 wifi and I've liked it except for the headphones jack.  I am having a weird problem with my Echo headphones in that it works on everything, iPad 3G, computers (windows and mac), and everything else except the iPad. I went to Apple and it turns out that it's a specific iPad wifi model problem but they won't do anything since it is only my pair of headphones! But they work on everything else! It's so stupid that the 3G models have an upgraded headphone jack that will work with ANY headphones, including mine.  I might have bought that model if I knew that! Now i have to get another pair of headphones just for the iPad, which is ridiculous! Still a good tablet though!

I have a bad ipad and no one can help me get it fixed by trouble shooting the device.  You need to jump through hurdles and they do not think twice about asking you to delete your contacts, calender, etc.  If there is not a better way to troubleshoot, the product is not worth it.  Go with a different tablet- will be less expensive and you may get better support.	
549	2	4	4	1	4	4	4	1	1	4	4	4	Excellent. When I recieved it; it was in brand new condition. The fuctions work properly and I havnt encountered any problems with it thus far.

551	4	3	4	4	2	1	4	1	4	1	4	4	Excellent Product AND Amazon Rocks! . Received the IPAD quickly and in excellent condition (Amazon provides great service).  Outstanding product, the new Retina display is absolutely awesome!  After a few days I noticed that Apple was releasing a new model IPAD, one with a faster processor, better camera, etc.  I returned my IPAD to Amazon with no problems or delay in getting my credit card reimbursed since I was well within the Amazon return period.  Amazon rocks!  They provide unequaled service to the customer - great products, quick deliveries, reasonable prices and an outstanding return policy.  Whenever I want to buy anything, Amazon is the first place I visit and, almost all the time, where I buy my item(s).	
552	3	1	4	2	4	4	3	0	4	0	3	4	Ipad. Ipad is great, however it didn't come with a simm card. I bought it for my son,now I have to get myself one.	
553	3	4	4	2	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Moving on up. I recently came into a small fortune from a family inheritance.  I could only think of one thing I'd like to purchase with the $900 past down by recently deceased uncle.  It was about time I upgraded from my beeper and my Speak and Say.  Who the heck doesn't like an iPad?	
554	4	1	4	4	4	2	0	4	4	4	4	4	I like it. It does its job and keeps me in touch with different networks. It is a Mac so of course there are many things not compatible with PC software. Other than that it's fine	
555	3	4	4	2	3	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	IPAD new generation. IPAD was in great condition, no issues. There was even a extra included! Highly recommend purchases online service and price are great!Very pleased!	
556	4	4	4	4	4	3	0	2	4	1	3	4	I Pad Ratings: This was a gift for my wife and I now have my I Pad back, LOL. She really liking her own Pad and learning yet. The photos are awsome, Even Photos sent to her via I Phones are great quality. She is thinking she would of like to have the G3 over wi-fi so if you were to go on trip then apply for the G3 service only during those times.	
557	4	2	0	0	1	4	0	4	4	4	1	1	Defective. I am on my second IPad 3. Both units have WiFi  defects. Cannot maintain WiFi connection, even though multiple IPhones, Ipad, laptops at home are all connecting fine. Endless hours spent troubleshooting with Apple Support unsuccessful. Have tried everything recommended. They have no idea how to repair. Went online to find countless other customers experiencing the same defects. Apple Support not addressing it an obvious software or hardware defect. Expensive device (expensive junk)  - should work without  troubleshooting every time I want to use it. VERY DISAPPOINTED.	
558	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	0	0	4	4	I LOVE THIS! I'm still not totally sure what to do with this...but I love being able to pick it up and search for something that I just heard or seen.  My husband says it is a $500 Game Boy for me...and that is somewhat true...but am trying to use it for more useful things!  Still love it anyway!	
559	2	3	3	2	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	3	iPad. I like the iPad but it has some apps and games that I don't want.  I don't know how to get rid of them.  I am still learning how to use it.	
560	4	3	4	4	4	4	0	3	3	3	4	4	Love my iPad. The device is quick.  Makes me far more efficient.  I am also very pleased with the quality of the pictures it takes.  Not certain how I lived without it.	
561	4	4	4	3	4	3	2	4	4	4	4	4	Best ever. I endorse apple products it's the best tablet everResolution is greatOverheats a bit but it works well I'm impressed as usual apple is the best	
562	3	1	3	2	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	0	Charge me 40 bucks for returning and I didn't even open the package. Ridiculous distributor. I didn't open the package and changed my mind of buying IPAD3. Then I return to them and bought IPAD 4. They charged me 40 bucks which I don't believe that's the right way.I will not select them again. NEVER!!!	
563	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	0	4	1	4	4	Perfect. This works perfectly. It was bought for a friend and he always appreciate it. It is a  nice buy. thanks	
564	4	0	4	4	4	2	0	3	1	0	1	4	I love the iPad Mini, but not at a 20% above the price over Apple's Cost. Great product!!!BUT are you willing to purchase this from these sellers at a 20% price increase, when you can get it directly, which it will ship in 2 weeks, for $329 for the 16GB.  Currently Apple is shipping them in two weeks!  In addition, you can customize the ones you get directly from Apple... putting a name or some other custom phrase that would mark it as YOURS for free!!!!!I say, order from Apple DIRECTLY!!!	
565	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	1	4	4	4	Ipad mini item as described. I have apple ipad 2 and I was carrying all the time so I decided to get the mini ipad and keep it in my bag for more convinance and use ipad 2 at home it's my new computer it's easy to deal with.	
566	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	3	4	4	4	4	My 2 year old daughter loves it!!!! So, I made this purchase for my 2 year old daughter. It helps when we are in the supermarket or a restaurant because she's learning with the apps and it keeps her distracted for a few while I'm running my errands or enjoying our meals. She loves it! It's very kid friendly, great color, compact, very portable, WE LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!!!! I'm very happy with the purchase!!!!	
567	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	3	4	4	Great Tablet: And Notes About the EcoSystem. ABOUT THIS REVIEWERI'm a Prime Amazon customer. In this household we use Amazon to shop for all sorts of things.  I am an early adopter and love tech, but as we have come to rely on technology more and more, it has become less of a toy and something that simply has to work all the time, whether for an online web conference or for the kid's homework.ABOUT THE iPAD MINIConstruction: I was getting ready to write this review and managed to set my iPad mini on a bar-height kitchen counter top precariously, and it fell to the floor.  Hitting a wood floor no less.  Happy to report nothing happened. No scratches, no dings, operating just fine.  Didn't plan to start by writing about the construction of the iPad mini, but this is a device you'll move around a lot, take in the car, stuff in airplane seat pockets, cram into backpacks.  This thing is amazingly light, but built like a tank.  It can take it.Use: It is a joy to use.  Clear screen, easy operation, all the features work all the time... And of course you can find an application for just about anything.  Here is the best part, if you have more than one Tablet around (we have a couple iPads in the household), everything works the same way on the regular and the mini sized iPads.  Even better, using one account shared on these devices means that we only have to purchase an App once and we can use it on a couple different iPads.Choices: My wife prefers the larger iPad for email and my teens like the larger one for movies and drawing, but I love this mini size for travel.  It's just personal preference.  You can argue specs all you want, but basically the mini and the regular sized iPads are identical in function, battery life, apparent resolution, and so forth. The only question is your own preference as to size and weight. (And the Mini is less expensive than the full size.)Apps: Email is a breeze, web browsing is simple and quick, and if you are into photography, this little gem offers an amazing still shot and video camera. And with all those apps it can be just about anything from a network diagnostic tool to a book collection, from a banking tool to a game pad, or a weather forecaster to a music player...COST OF OWNERSHIPWhen it comes to picking a Tablet, think about the purchase price over time. I have PC netbooks in the house that lasted less than a year.  Most of the PC laptops lasted 2 years or so.  But the Apple products simply don't quit.  We have an original iPad that is as good as new, and Apple desktops and laptops that keep getting handed down from one family member to another because they don't stop.  Yes, they are more expensive to purchase at first, but we save a huge amount of money because they keep working for years and years.  We don't have money to waste, that's for sure.TOTAL ECOSYSTEMAnd here is the real decision point, at least for this household.  It's all about the ecosystem, or the suite of hardware and software that work together.  I'm no longer content to have a cool laptop, or a great Tablet.. I want it all working together, and this is where Apple products shine. We have personal and family calendars that update on our phones, tablets, desktops and laptops.  We do the same with email and magazine subscriptions and so much more.  We can share photos and music on all of these devices and on the TV as well (hooked to an Apple TV box). We can save files "in the cloud" and access them from anywhere, anytime, on any device.  This is how it is supposed to work.  My son is into programming and finds the Unix-based environment of the Mac to be the best place to work.  My daughter is into photography and has professional-level tools at the ready.  My wife is doing genealogy research and helping the kids with school (and life in general), and I have a company to run.  It's all on this integrated, connected, suite that works all the time, without nearly any effort from me to keep it running. And backups?  All automatic and all in the cloud, and yes, I've had to recover from backups before and it worked like it was supposed to.As I said at the start, we use Amazon Prime all the time. Love it. But I want the technology in our household to be what we want it to be, not a constant reminder to buy more.  Really disappointed that Amazon created their Kindle Fires as a way to sell more stuff. And yes, you can turn off the adds (by paying to do so), but not the recommendations. Beyond that, though, the Kindles and Kindle Fire are not part of an overall solution that can work together.SAFE and STABLEWe used to be a PC household, but that required 10 to 15 hours of month of "tech support" time from me to keep the computers and laptops and network operating.  No longer. It just works.  I also appreciate that the UNIX backbone of the Mac OS is less susceptible to viruses and the like. I don't have time to worry about the problems that Android phones are having now with viruses or hackers either.  True, all platforms can be attacked, but we are dealing with orders of magnitude here; the Apple world is more locked down, but in return I get more stability and we spend less time making it all work.CUSTOMER SUPPORTBack to this theme of saving time.  I love the fact that I can open up my iPad or my laptop and reserve an appointment at my local Apple Store with a few clicks.  Walk in the store, have the person up front confirm my arrival and be working with a decent tech person in just a few minutes.  I've had nothing but great service, and several times they went well beyond: as with older machines that were way past warranty but fixed at no charge, or the time I had an iPhone with a scratched camera lens. Replaced on the spot, no charge. If you are honest with them, they will be with you.So, that's our story.  Hope this has been useful for you in some way.	
568	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	0	3	4	4	4	The IPAD MINI is everything Apple promised it to be!!! The Mini is as light and handy as Apple advertised it to be! It can do everything 'big brother' can do! It totally met my expectation. It is fast and sleek, a lean, mean machine, easy to understand. Shipping experience with AJ Wholesale was awesome.	
569	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	2	0	4	4	wow. love the nice slim look, not heavy when you traveling a must have when youre always on the go and need the internet

571	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	1	4	4	Awesome mini tablet. Love this iPad mini. Fast processor with strong WiFi antenna. Nice camera. Tons of applications. Going to get it for only $329 @ Best Buy though.	
572	4	4	4	1	4	0	4	2	1	4	4	4	Light, Thin and easy to read, a great product. The best facebook and email product.. 1000s of apps that work, easy to use and did I say everything works right out of the box.	
573	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	I love this tablet. This is an amazing tablet/computer. It's so light and the thinnest tablet I've ever seen. 7.9 inches may seem small on your computer screen, but it's actually a decent size. And light and small enough to hold in only one hand. It's perfect for typing papers with Pages. But I do recommend buying a BlueTooth keyboard, which is what I am using now to type this review. Watching movies is awesome. And games from the App Store are so fun to play. The only down side is that it's not as clear as the full size iPad. But that really isn't a big deal unless you're super crazy about that kind of stuff. Otherwise I highly recommend this tablet to anyone looking for something like this. I hope you decide to buy one, it'll be worth the money.

576	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	Goodbye Ipad, Hello Ipad Mini!! I have a 4th generation Ipod Touch 64gb and an Ipad2 16gb.When the ipad mini was announced, I wasn't impressed.  I was fully satisfied w/ my ipad2. Only thing that was making me consider getting the mini was its portability.  With the ipad2, you have to have it in a case, plus a bag if you don't want to accidentally drop it...plus setting it up, etc...Well, I ordered the mini last week and I haven't been able to put it down!!  I absolutely love this thing!Unexpected surprises...- the weight...it feels like you're holding a piece of cardboard...it's light.- the speakers...they're loud & it doesn't matter whether u place it on its front or back, u can hear them perfectly...and u get stereo speakers that sound soooo much better than my ipad2 and louder, clearer, etc...  I've been listening to music on this way more than on my ipad2...- the cameras...front and back...they are a very nice upgrade and the back camera is nice b/c it doesn't matter whether u take a pic, light or dark, it comes out nicely lighted and clear...  isight camera must use every available slither of light to give u a decent pic in just about any bad lighting situation, which is unexpected coming from a tablet.-typing...for some reason, it seems soooo natural to type on the mini... it's a one and a halfer by its size, but it feel effortless-screen resolution...after reading endless reviews about the mini NOT having a retina display, I almost didn't buy it...BUT I love this screen...it is tight, crisp, and I have no problems reading...in fact, the videos that I watch on here are INCREDIBLE... so, for those of you on the fence about the screen resolution, it's a non-issue as far as I'm concerned...don't cheat yourself, like I almost did...I've been watching videos and finishing them in one sitting...that's how nice the screen is...I see things I didn't notice on my ipad2Sadly, I haven't had the desire to pick up my ipad2 since I got the mini... I will have this thing for a very long time... Oh, and if you decide to get one, get 32gb or 64gb...I have the 64gb and I absolutely love it!!!	
577	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	0	3rd party seller scams. Your NEW Amazon iPad might be USED. Here's how to tell. The product itself is fantastic and my stars are based on the product being a great deal and a great device.But for anyone thinking of buying from Amazon, be warned. I purchased one of these for someone on her birthday and it was listed as new.  Amazon seems to only sell iPad minis from third party sellers, not from Amazon.com itself, meaning another company gets the iPads from any source they want, sends them to Amazon, and Amazon ships them. One of these sellers listed an iPad mini slightly above retail price, but cheaper than all of the other iPad minis on Amazon. In fact, when I searched for iPad mini, it was the seller and product page the site automatically directed me to. The page indicated it as new, and sold it to me via Amazon.  When my friend got her iPad mini, it looked new, was packaged and sealed like new, but when she turned it on, it was tied to someone else's icloud account. I called apple and gave them the serial number. Sure enough, the item was used, only had about 60 days left in the warranty (instead of 90) and was registered through Apple to a different customer.  If I wanted a used iPad Mini, I would have paid less. Much less.I even emailed the user who had previously owned it (since her email address via iCloud was showing up when my friend tried to access the app store. I emailed the previous user just to make sure it wasn't a stolen product. She explained that she had purchased it a few weeks back from At&T;, not from Amazon. She wanted a wifi + 3g version, not just wifi, so she returned it and somehow, the third party seller got their hands on it and sold it to me as new.In the defense of of the third party seller, once I got their phone number from Amazon and called them (most seller numbers are not on Amazon, you have to call and request a phone number), they provided a scary explanation: They explained that there are problems with Amazon's FBA system (fulfillment). Sometimes, iPads are returned with nothing but index cards in the box and Amazon thinks there is an iPad inside. Sometimes, products mingle, and so another seller's used iPads might be with a different seller's new iPads. They explained that they have a very legitimate source of iPads and have been selling iPads for years and that this is a rare occurrence, although it has happened before. I have no way of verifying any of this, so I can't blame Amazon or the seller. All I can say is that for such a large purchase, and one that is a gift, you are better off buying from a major retail store that doesn't sell used items at all (or buying from Amazon when it is shipped and sold and fulfilled by Amazon).  Right now, this product is actually on sale at Walmart.Amazon refunded me but now my friend has to return her birthday gift. I recommend buying from someone other than Amazon. For this particular product, it's probably the cheaper route to do that anyway. If you do buy from Amazon, call Apple with your Serial Number and verify it is a new, unregistered product with a full 90 day warranty. Don't get scammed.	
578	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	0	4	4	4	Great! Just as powerful as an ipad, but lighter and easier to carry around.  Its not the same multimedia experience because the screen is smaller, but its an awesome gadget.

580	4	4	4	4	4	3	1	4	1	1	4	4	Moved from the Kindle Fire (1st gen) to the iPad Mini, loving the change. I bought the original Kindle Fire when it was first released. I was so excited to get it, I pre-ordered in advance so I could have release day delivery. And for the next several months, I loved it. The screen was beautiful. However I had a few scares with it.The first issue I had with the Kindle was on a few occasions, it just didn't turn on. After discovering how to do a hard-reset, I was able to get it back up and running, and just did this whenever it wouldn't turn on again. Then one day while I was playing music on it via the iHeartRadio application, it started to overheat (wasn't aware that the Kindle even could overheat) and after the music that was playing started skipping, it froze up. I picked it up and found the back near the battery hot to the touch. It would not turn off, so I did a hard reset (as suggested by Amazon). After that, it never turned back on. Thankfully, Amazon quickly replaced my Kindle Fire (for free) and when I received my new one, everything was back to normal. However by this time, I had gotten my first iPhone (4s). I was surprised how much faster the internet browser and applications ran on my small phone, compared to the Kindle Fire. So I ended up using my iPhone more often than my Kindle.On month after Amazon replaced my 1st generation Kindle Fire, they released the new line of Kindles. I almost ordered one of the new HD ones, but decided to wait and see how the reviews compared to this iPad mini, which was released around the same time.Now months later, I'm hearing reports from people who did order the new Kindle Fire HD that they too are running into problems here and there with this new version. After doing a lot of research, I discovered that statistically, Apple products have fewer claims for warranty work than other brands. I'm by no means an Apple-Fangirl, and prefer to use Windows PC's in my own home. But I hate having my brand new items break down, even if they are covered by a warranty. When I spend hundreds on something, I just want it to work, and would rather never need to know how how good a warranty is or not. So the statistics of the Apple products having better reliability was the deciding factor.When comparing the Kindle Fire to the iPad mini, I will say that Kindle (especially the new ones) have a more vivid screen. The Kindle screens are beautiful and the colors are amazing. However that's where the majority of the advantages over the Mini ended for me. The iPad mini has nice web browser, the applications work well (less crashing issues), the wireless connection is fast and I didn't have any sort of lag between turning on my Mini and getting online, like I often did with my Kindle. The mini has been everything I hoped it would be, and I love the size.The iPad mini is super thin. So thin, I actually worry at times it's too slim. It's such a nice piece of hardware, I tend to worry that the ultra slim design might make it too delicate. Thankfully, they make cases like the OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPad Mini for people like myself who want to put the delicate Mini into a super duty case. I'm glad I did, since it's taken a tumble or two in the last month I've owned it, and inside the case it stays unharmed.I do love the small size of the Mini. I needed something smaller than the large iPad, but also needed something larger than my iPhone. Something that would fit into my handbag, but that I could also easily read, check and reply to my email on. The screen is very responsive and the speakers produce nice sound, better than the iPhone's. The Mini is perfect for me, and I'm so glad decided on it. Everything works just as well or better than I had hopped for, and I've passed my Kindle Fire down to my pre-teen daughter, who loves it.	
581	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	1	4	1	4	4	iPad mini. I really love this mini iPad. I don't have any other tablets so maybe they would all seen just as fun but it is so speedy, easy to use. I do have a mac book pro so the OS is familiar to me.	
582	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	3	4	4	4	3	Tiny. Consistent. Quality. These days Apple is losing the excitement factor over the Android phones and tablets that are fancier and come in enough shapes and sizes to suit your taste. I, myself, have tried the Android phones and tablets but have come back to Apple for two main reasons: Consistency and Quality,I have always wanted an iPad but the cumbersome and awkward size was always the turn off to me. I wanted something easy to carry and put away; the iPad just seemed a bit too large. I eventually gave in to an Android tablet and Enjoyed it to an extent but it became clunky and cluttered. The quality felt a bit too plasticky as well.Then Apple announced the iPad Mini and I was ready to give it a try. THIS DEVICE ROCKS! I cannot say enough good things about it; it's the quality hardware and software Apple is known for. I can always count on my iPad Mini to work and do so like it did the first time, never slowing down.So... If you are in the market for a small tablet and don't mind paying the premium I highly recommend the iPad Mini. Sure, it's a bit more expensive but if you have it know you are paying for a slick device that won't turn into a frustrating paper weight next year. :)	
583	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	4	My initial experience. I had a poor experience with the initial start up.  When I called the number on the one sheet " user guide "the "support" person was no help,  made me wait for someone who was to know something.  His main interest was in selling me a $165.00 support package.  I didn't buy!!  All I wanted was someone to help me past the opening screen.  I have family help that achieved that.  I love the actual iPad though.  The key board is small for my fat fingers but that is no fault of the iPad.	
584	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	4	Loved mine so much I bought my mother one! Loved mine so much I bought my mother a Wifi only version. She loves it and uses it more than either of us expected.	
585	2	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	Happy! I'm so happy with my iPad Mini!!!  I've already found so many great uses for it and am excited to take it on vacation with us!  I read reviews about the WiFi version not necessarily connecting to the internet very consistently, but I have found quite the opposite!The display is more than I expected, the apps availability is fantastic and the size is perfect!  My iPhone is too small to be useful for anything more than sporadic searches, but the Mini is great!  I can search just like I would on my laptop, but in a much more convenient way, i.e. I don't have to lug around my laptop and I don't need a lot of space!	
586	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	0	1	4	4	my wife loves it... i bought this as a replacement for my wife's ipad 2. at first she wasn't sure about it but after playing with it and seeing for herself how it surpassed her old ipad she just loves it.. "it is a great size" her words for reading, she uses it for school, work and the occasional netflix viewing.. great item for the individual who wants super portability with the right size screen for reading and more...	
587	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	1	1	4	4	4	Better than Std I-Pad. It's what I hoped it would be - a replacement for my original iPad 2. It's more portable, easier to hold, lighter than the original. It does everything the larger one does. It's larger than a 7" android tablet. It fits my needs perfectly. And oh yes, it has Sari too!	
588	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	Come on,  its Apple! Very light and portable. I love it. The full iPad experience in a smaller version. The big iPad is too big for my taste. iPad Mini is perfect for watching movies, reading books, surfing the net, shopping, and listening to music. People complain about the screen resolution but I don't have any problems reading or looking at it. You can notice a difference if you have an iphone. But its not a huge difference. Its wonderful to have a small tablet. Apple has done exceptionally well with iPad Mini. Go for it, but it if you can.	
589	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	1	4	4	4	Works great. It's fast, light, good battery life. It does everything u want for quick entertainment. Very easy to hold as well.	
590	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	0	4	1	3	4	Go Apple. I've always liked Apple products and this one is great! I like that it is smaller then the iPad 2 and yet not so small that I can't see things on the web and I read in bed or play games at night when I can't sleep.  Great for people who need to be in bed because of illness. However, I find it sometimes hard to see the header menus. You can't seem to change the font size on those. The other thing I think needs improvement is the thing is hard to hang on to. When I am reading with my thumbs gripping the sides, the screen is touched and the page I was reading turns to the next page.  A case is a must!	
591	4	4	3	4	4	2	4	3	4	3	4	4	Perfect in every way. Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. Another outstanding apple product. I also own the iPad with retina display.	
592	4	4	4	4	4	1	2	4	1	4	4	4	perfect as any apple product. perfect, comes well sealed, I have nothing more to say, anyone who knows Apple products know that you will be 100% satisfied!	
593	4	4	4	1	4	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	Dealer sent the wrong iPad. So disappointed with this transaction.  I was eagerly awaiting my white iPad Mini that I ordered and they sent a black one with a label over the description so I didn't realize I had the wrong product until I opened up the box.  I tried to order another but it was getting so complicated and close to a trip that I wanted to use the iPad on, I just returned it and purchased the correct item at Walmart where I instantly received it and it was cheaper too!	
594	3	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	1	0	4	4	AWESOME TABLET!!! Got this for my husband for our anniversary and he already has an IPod, but I thought he could use that for all his music, he loves that thing, and has so much music on it. but I thought that by getting him the tablet, he could transfer his games, pics, and whatever else he keeps on there to the IPad Mini. I about died when he kept it!!! He's a very difficult man to buy for! We've been married 29 years, so I was like I'm going for it, I can always send it back with Amazon. But he loves it!!! I don't use it, I have my own stuff. Kindle Fire HD, which rocks and we both have Iphones, so you can't lose with an Apple product!!! He's on it every night, now he's buying more music for his other device and has what he needs on his IPad Mini. And it's so thin, so if we go away, it goes in our Electric Gadget bag, with our chargers and it's awesome!! And on the day I bought this whole package, the IPad Mini, the case that shuts it off and turns it on, and the protector sheets, I paid under $380 for everything!!! It pays to be an Amazon Prime Member!!!! You get the best deals, no hassles on returns, you have 30 days to return something, and if you have a problem, all you have to do is call them!! I love the ease and the customer service!!! I've yet to have any kind of issue with Amazon!!! For this whole package, it said 2-3 days max for delivery!! It was here the next night at 5pm!! I was shocked!!!! But, it was here and that's what I love about Amazon!!! They ROCK!!! Now reviewing all the books I've bought for my Kindle, I'll try to get to them!!! LOL I already have tons of books, and every single day I get BookBub in my Email and it's the books on sale or FREE books!!! Amazing....I love them!!! I do most of my shopping on Amazon and because I'm a Prime Member, I don't pay for shipping. I hate going to Malls...you get better prices on here for Bluray movies, electronics, kids toys, and shipping is free as long as it's a Prime item. I've talked enough!! Amazon ROCKS and I'll always come here first before I go anywhere else.	
595	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	LOVE IT. This is the BEST gadget ever.  I use it all the time and still learning some of the features but it is FANTASTIC	
596	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	0	4	4	4	Wonderful deal. The iPad mini is new and no opened. And seller send out the parcel very fast. Of course, the price is also very good.This is a gift for my friend. He is very happy to get it before he leaving.	
597	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	1	4	4	4	4	Mini Plus keyboard = terrific! I bought a mini keyboard also which makes a great little portable computer.  My potable computer had aged out and this makes a great tool for note takig.	
598	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	APPLE iPad Mini MD531 LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi, White) I LOVE IT... EASY TO USE..THE SCREEN IS EASY TO SEE AT NIGHT & LIGHTS REALLY WELL...1ST TIME I EVER HAD ONE...IT ARRIVED ON TIME	
599	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	2	4	One. Piece design was not what I expected.  This is a magnetic cover only.  Provides no protection to base and limited protection to face.My plan was to return it until I found a clear hard plexiglass cover, made by Rocktfish, that the tablet securely snaps into. Then the magnetic iPad cover slips perfectly into place as if they were designed for this purpose.I still wish there was a full cover designed by Apple for the iPad mini.  This is swell for now.  Fits nicely, very slim profile, in my handbag without conflict.	
600	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	0	4	4	The Mini is Great. The mini is a great tool.  The size makes it much more portable than the original.  The battery life may be a bit less than that of the ipad2.	
601	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	Love it! Received this a s a gift from my sister as I was presenting her with this as well! Great minds think alike! While she is a technology/electronic snob, I am more easy to please but I really love the iPad Mini and use it every day!!	
602	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	0	0	4	4	4	Ipad Mini. This is my 2nd apple product in which i purchase because I am a college student. I bought it so that I am able to download textbooks and also use for my personal business. Ipad mini works great and I am very happy with this product	
603	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	4	Great Pruduct!! To me there is no other product better than apple items . They are indeed really well made. Their technical suupport staff is always there to help you!

605	4	4	3	4	4	1	1	4	1	2	3	4	This product has all the function regular Ipad with reasonable price. Speed is pretty good and unlike android technology,user friendly devise which I love it most.I will spread words to my friends.	
606	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Mini Ipad. We like it! I wanted the regular Ipad, but my husband wanted this one. I would much rather have the bigger one! This one is fun though and will get allot of use!	
607	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	It's an iPad. Lots lighter than my full size version and well suited for traveling.  I mainly use this one for reading and surfing the internet.	
608	3	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	3	0	2	4	Ok but not thrilled. Well this ipad mini is nice - clear bright screen, every bit as nice as a full sized ipad.  Except the wi-fi.  I got this to save my back - so I wouldn't have to carry my laptop to work.  But I'm pretty disappointed in the wi-fi.  It has less connection ability than my husband's kindle fire.  The only way I can use it at work, or even in the bedroom at home, is to use my iphone as a mobile hotspot.  It will not and can not connect to my home network or work network - doesn't seem to have the connection range as the kindle fire or my laptop.  If I hadn't already "moved into" it, I'd be returning it.  I am not happy with the very limited connection range.	
609	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	1	4	4	4	Works great as an e-reader, taking pictures, video and surfing the web. This review is for the ipad mini 16GB Wi-Fi in blackI bought this ipad mini for a birthday present for my wife, she has one of the original nooks for reading digital books and an ipod G4 and she wanted a device that would eliminate having to use the nook and ipod, the ipad mini is the perfect solution for this! I was torn between getting the mini or the regular size ipad, I chose the mini because its about the same size as her nook, the ipad mini is thinner than the nook which we have now given to our 12 year old daughter for books she is required to read for school, we'll be giving the ipod to a less fortunate family that cannot afford one as my daughter has her own ipod.The Apple app for reading digital books (called ibooks) is actually better than the nook because books can be read in different orientations. ibooks supports PDF format and epub, epub displays the best as it has options to change the font size etc. Any books that come in PDF can be converted to epub (or other formats) for free on numerous converters found online.Game apps load much faster on the ipad and are much more enjoyable to play than on the ipodThe wireless is much better on the ipad than on the ipod as the ipod kept disconnecting and reconnecting from the Internet on our home network, the ipad mini doesn't have this problem.Surfing the Internet is a breeze as well, my wife never used her ipod to surf the Internet, now that she has the ipad mini she surfs the web frequently.It takes great pictures and video which are then uploaded to FB.We'll be taking the ipad mini with us on a cruise and we'll see how it performs once connected to the wireless network on the ship, we'll be using it to check email etc, I'll be updating this review in regard to performance after the cruise.I have never used the standard size ipad so I cannot compare the mini to the standard ipad.	
610	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	3	0	2	4	4	great. what's not to love about an ipad... and the 32 GB seems better.  my daughter got he 16 and now wishes for more...	
611	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	Great little tech toy. Bought this so my daughter would stop using my regular iPad to play all her games but liked it so much I've sort of switched and use this one and give her my old one!	
612	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	2	0	4	4	4	Love it, a great tool to take along. We are loving our mini. Its great for work and my daughter loves to use it. There are so many good apps.	
613	4	4	4	4	4	1	3	4	4	4	4	4	awsome. Great product.this was truly a great buy it works great for my girl going back to school. I am impressed.	
614	3	4	4	4	4	4	2	2	4	4	4	4	As expected - Great. Works great as expected. iOS 7 loaded and processor can handle that version as well.The smaller form factor is nice.Recommended.	
615	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	4	Best price and fantastic item. Thank you the I pad is almost like new and thank you for the covers. Also, the price is a great	
616	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	0	0	4	4	Perfect size. I've been an apple fan for a while. We still even have our fist generation iPad 16 GB. When I first saw that apple released a smaller iPad, I thought it was kind of pointless. I was recently given this iPad mini from my employees and I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I have enjoyed using it. The size, weight and performance is just right. I can't complain. I use it every day for surfing the web. The battery life has been great. I picked up a knock-off Smart Cover case for $9 on Amazon and I'm all set. I highly recommend it.	
617	3	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	0	4	4	Easy to use - not a huge hit to the wallet. Wow - this is really cool!  I bought this to process credit card sales online and it does so many cool things besides.  I'm not terribly computer savvy but Apple is very user friendly.	
618	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	Prompt delivery and as described. Read the previous reviews and decided to try.  I can confirm: 1) received on the earliest day of the anticipated time, 2) shipped same day, 3) condition is really like newThx a million.	
619	3	4	0	4	4	2	4	4	4	3	0	0	USED AND DEFECTIVE!!!! Bought item for company Christmas party.  The recipient opened package and item would not turn on.  I contacted apple support and they stated that iPad was purchased back in July and registered to another person.  I was sold a used and defective product.  Sending it back for a return.	
620	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	0	3	2	1	1	My  profound admiration for the amazing success of what I consider to be an exceptionally limited, overpriced device. We purchased a 1st generation iPad Mini to test some of our websites. With the exception of a shiny white iMac computer, and older 30 gig iPod  we are a Windows centric business. I have access to an older Pandigital android tablet, Kindle Fire, Asus RT, Acer W500 running WIndows 8.1 pro and WIndows 8 phone.Yes, the iPad was easy to learn but I have been working with computer technologies since 1977. The build quality good but not any more impressive than that of my Asus RT tablet and the Dell Venue Pro 8 I worked with for a few days. My hat off to Apple for getting folks to accept a consumption device that does not support flash or something as simple as downloading MP3 files from sites other than iTunes. I spent $4.95 for a browser app that supports flash. In all my years of using computers, this is the first time I have felt compelled to buy a browser!If I want to view and hear a YouTube video posted in the Facebook app, I must display it in Safari. The Apps store and iTunes take an exceptionally long time to load. I had to add an app just to be able to download our MP3 files! Speech commands and dictation require you be on line for Siri to connect with Apple servers (shades of Chromebook dependency on a Wi-Fi connection.) We all know how "secure" our internet data is so why not? (cough, cough) In Windows 8 tablets,the free built-in Microsoft Speech to text and control software is designed for off line as well as on line use.Even after adjusting font size options, screen print is often too small to read comfortably and zoom does not always work. Wi-Fi is slower than any other portable device I own. I can't argue against success but am dumbfounded such a limited device with an equally impressive high price has become the tablet standard. I am spoiled by tablets that allow full access to flash sites, true off line accessibility and file downloads. True, the Windows apps store is limited but I don't need many of the Apple apps that add functionality built-in to my other devices.Apple and Jobs deserve my  profound admiration for the amazing success of what I consider to be an exceptionally limited, overpriced device. Bravo.	
621	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	Couldn't be happier! I owe apple big time for potty training my 2 yr old. We bought it to put a few learning games and some movies to keep my daughter occupied on long trips and when we go out to dinner (rarely) Not only did it serve it's purpose, but my daughter LOVED her iPad so much that we used it as a reward for going potty, in less than 2 weeks we ditched the diapers and we were 100% potty trained. I personally love the ipad for virtually everything. Movies, games, online shopping, music, etc. The battery life is phenomenal! Now that my daughter thinks its all hers I will probably be picking up an iPad air... no Droid for me!	
622	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	2	4	4	This is a gift for xmas. I can not give a review as it is a gift for my granddaughter for xmas.I am sure she will like it.	
623	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	Apple is always best! Apple pretty much sells itself so there's no need for commenting on this. I have always been an Apple fan!	
624	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	3	4	Better than I thought. Its good so far, wife really likes it. Bought it for her home business and other things to free her up from having to use the PC at home all the time.	
625	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	Awesome. Amazing!!  Steve Jobs knew what he was doing!  Died too young! Now I want to buy onee for the whole family!!	
626	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	2	3	4	4	Best bang for the buck! Like all of Apples products, this iPad mini is top notch! It has good performance and is second to none!	
627	4	4	4	0	4	2	4	4	2	4	4	4	Apple IPad. I use an I Pad at my place of employment and liked it and decided that I could use one for my personal use.	
628	4	4	4	4	4	2	2	4	3	2	4	4	Good as always. Product good as always, Apple makes it easy to setup and get going.No issues and like the white color.  Did not get the retina display, and its fine without it.  No need to spend the extra cash.	
629	0	4	0	1	0	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	Opened and not new in box. iPad was not sealed in the box. It had been opened and was it new in box. Not a good thing.	
630	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	0	0	2	4	4	great product. Have never owned ipad previous and after shopping around, decided it would be difficult to beat another Apple product. Really like this product. Set up and getting started was very easy. the ipad mini can do more that i expected. Features are simply great. I would definitely recommend this product. The price from Amazon was also great.	
631	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	Love iPad mini. Love the versatility of the iPad mini.  I highly recommend this product. Awesome amount of storage and ease of use.

633	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	1	4	4	love it better than the ipad 1,2or3. I love my ipad mini. I like it because I can use it instead of my iphone all the time. I have a ipad 3 and i can say that I like the ipad mini better because of the size. I dont care if i have retnia display because i cant tell aa difference. I bought my ipad mini from target and the price was better than amazon. I like how light and small the product is. I used to have an android tablet but i am glad that i when with apple. The appstore has more apps and itunes too. I love my ipad mini and i recermend it. :)	
634	4	4	3	4	4	2	2	3	4	4	4	4	Happy Happy Happy. Ordered this product for my daughter-in-law because she needed something smaller than a regular Ipad. She said she loves it!  It was.perfect Chrtstmas gift.  Iove Amazon!!!!	
635	3	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	0	4	4	Excellent as all Apple products. I have another iPad, so I bought this for my niece and she loves it. She's downloaded some applications she'll need for studying some topics for her medical carreer, which are very helpfull.	
636	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	0	2	1	4	4	Great Christmas. This, Item was the best purchase, I have ever transacted online .I will purchase one more .as a gift to someone.

638	4	4	4	4	4	0	1	2	4	4	4	4	Fast delivery. This was a gift, so I just know that my son really likes it and has downloaded much of his smartphone info.I was impressed with such a fast delivery since it was so close to Christmas and timely delivery was notguaranteed.  Got here with time to spare!	
639	4	4	4	4	4	2	3	0	4	1	4	4	Christmas present to my mom. My mom loves this gift we sent her. It arrrived  on time just like the company promised. She is 71 and is able to do almost everything you you do on a pc. She loves to read so this is a welcome  aspect. She can take it in her purse on vacation and anywhere else.	
640	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	4	Its a new iPad mini!!! WOW!!! They described it as "Refurbished", but it is new!!! I'm sooo happy with my purchase!!! Definitely recommend this product.	
641	4	4	4	4	4	1	3	4	2	3	4	4	Great product. I absolutely love my Ipad mini.  It does everything my big computer does and is quick to start up. The battery lasts for days. Clarity is perfect, and the size is just right for everything I do. I highly recommend this product.	
642	3	4	4	4	4	1	0	2	0	0	4	4	Excellent! I bought this for my nephew.  He loves it!  I am so happy I was able to find something he would like so muc!	
643	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	Love the form factor, I own a gen 2 iPad and use it all the time.  My next iPad will be of the mini persuasion since I really like that size. Will probably wait till the next release to see what new enhancements Apple is working on.  I purchased this one for my brother.  He also likes the size and fact that is so easy to conceal when traveling.	
644	3	4	4	4	4	1	0	4	4	4	3	4	Excellent product, but needs more information on specific model. Great product, of course. It IS an Apple product after all. The seller's description was accurate and delivery was swift.Very happy overall.I had to knock off one star because of the confusion I went through trying to determine the generation model of the ipad before I made the purchase. I had wanted a 2nd gen, 32 gig, ipad mini. However, there was NO information as to whether the ipad listed was a first gen or second gen. Other than a brief comment in the questions area indicating that the seller didn't know.Turns out the ipad that was sent to me is a first gen. Not that it matters really. Right now, there isn't much difference between the two generations. But it would have been helpful to have that important bit of info available.Overall tho, it was a positive experience. I'd buy from the seller again happily.	
645	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	love it! I absolutely love it!!! It has such great features and I love that it only needs WiFi. I can use it on vacations that I am not able to use my phone because of roaming and what not. So glad I thought it.	
646	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	3	0	3	4	4	Best purchase ever. I debated over the regular sized IPad and the mini.  I am glad I chose the mini, it fits easily in my bag.  I have gotten a key board, which makes this extremely versatile.  I would recommend this to anyone.	
647	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	4	Love my iPad! I had a tablet which I thought was fantastic until my friend came over with her iPad. I tried hers and fell in love so... I got my own. I am very happy with it! It came quickly and is so fun and easy to use. Very satisfied with I purchase!	
648	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	3	3	0	4	4	I love my ipad mini/accessories!!!! It was an excellent price. I psid $299 for it. I havent had any problems with the oroduct. And the delivery was fast. I got the stand alsi at a great cost. it was a oackets deal with car charger and scree protector for the ipad mini. excellenr. thanks you guys!!!	
649	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	4	3	4	4	4	great gift for my kindergartener. yes, that's right we got this for kindergartner and it was the best purchase we made in a long time. we use it for her spelling words, reading books, movies (on weekends) and she even download apps for her favorite games and magazines like highlights... love this is as a learning too and source of entertainment.	
650	3	4	4	4	4	0	2	2	0	4	4	4	Excellent. As always Apple makes the most excellent products. This is great, a smaller size, sotake into account if you wear reading glasses you might want the regular size iPad.But this is wonderful and you can do so many things with it. Easy to carry anywhere.Apple always has my vote of 5 stars! I've never been disappointed.	
651	1	4	4	4	4	2	2	1	1	4	1	4	So so product has flaws. Same deal as everywhere else , but issue with shut down continues to exit safari and mail without notification no fix provided for this as of yet  (closes apps unexpectedly )	
652	0	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	4	3	3	Apple iPad mini. Once I figured how to use it, I like it.  There should be an instruction book with it.  Through a mixup w order cart two were sent to me and charged also, although I had deleted  one of them on my order.  Was rather disappointed by that. Didn't bother returning it , as I figured that would be goofed up too.	
653	3	4	1	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	0	4	Shipped with old iOS #6. Watch out for purchasing your NEW iPad mini.  We knew nothing about Apple products.The unit was shipped last month, via FedesxSmartPost (which was a headache, very poor shipping)with the old iOS6 operating system which the people at the Apple Store fixed right away with a 20minute download. So, if you are wanting to buy from Amazon, know that they are fulfilling orders withvery old stock of I pad mini's!	
654	4	4	4	4	4	2	0	0	1	1	4	4	great tablet even for children. lots of games and education tools. My children love it. We have already two for the three children (some disputes occur...).	
655	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	iPad mini. I love this product, I am a recent Apple convert and I'll never go back. Easy to use, set up, and navigation is a breeze! I am so happy with my purchase, it is priced to move the only complaint I have is with the delivery. My iPad mini was left balanced on top of my gate where it could have been stolen or fallen off to break, I was home waiting for it to be delivered and there is no excuse for that. BTW,...it wasn't shipped via a big service or the usps,...	
656	0	3	3	4	4	0	4	4	0	1	0	4	Bad shipping. Of course we all love the item but I was very disappointed that these 2 mini iPads I ordered were just left at the door on the floor I don't live in the suburbs so I was clearly upset that they didn't require a signature at the door for these pricey items. Anyone could have stole them so that makes me mad that Amazon didn't require a signature I am an honest person so I didn't report that I never received them.	
657	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	3	1	3	4	Apple Ipad mini. I bought this as a gift for someone and they absolutely love it. this was the second one I bought on amazon.	
658	4	4	4	4	4	0	4	4	3	4	4	4	It's apple! Nuff said. Have 3 iPads. This is our first mini. What a great size, great screen, and happy wife! Thank you for the help!	
659	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	Great Media Toy. Not the newest iPad out but still great. With the 3G model I can get internet access when i need it!	
660	4	4	4	4	4	0	2	4	0	0	4	2	Bad charger. I love my mini, but I've had it one month and the charger  doesn't work.  I am quite upset that I have to go out and purchase a new charger. Apple should make a charger that lasts as long as the iPad mini.	
661	4	4	0	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	Stable and fast, but annoying for advanced users. Good, stable system and fast, but really closed to advanced users. Using iTunes for upload files is very annoying. iOS is perfect for beginners, because the system is stable and they will be unable to install damaging softwares.	
662	0	4	4	3	1	0	4	2	4	4	1	4	wrong production. i book a white one , but they give me a black one. and label the production is a white one	
663	4	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	Couldn't be happier. Delivery service amazing.  Called apple when it came in and it's brand new never owned, I am the first owner. Couldn't be happier with the product and b&e; who sold it to me.	
664	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	4	4	4	4	The only tablet for the person on the go ! The iPad Mini is my right hand . Email , books , magazines , weather , appointment book , alarm clock ,  and so much more . I will not be caught without it .Note I ordered it for next day delivery . I got it at 9:00 am the next morning !!! Amazon you people are awesome!!!	
665	3	4	0	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	My boys love it! I initially purchased 16GB mini pads from Amazon for my children. I highly suggest not buying anything less than 32 GB as there is never enough storage on 16GB. We were having to delete games or other applications to make room.	
666	4	4	4	4	4	4	0	3	0	4	3	4	Working as expected. It is what I expected for the price.The newest iOS update made it feel a little slow at times.But for my needs, cost-benefit is just right.	
667	4	4	4	3	4	4	0	0	4	2	4	4	Great gift for children! Gave this to my granddaughter for her 4th Birthday an the child just loves to sit an learn.  We down loaded some learning programs an it makes the little princess sit on the sofa an learn rather then watch TV!  When she's done she puts it on the kitchen table!  She's already learning being carful along with good learning time!	
668	4	3	4	4	4	2	4	4	2	2	4	4	iPad Mini. I'm really loving my Apple IPad Mini it's a great product to buy or to give as a gift... Amazon is the best	
669	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	2	4	4	Love it so much! I absolutely adore this device. It does everything I possibly need and more. Highly recommend this. And it was in great condition and great packaging	
670	4	4	4	4	4	2	2	2	2	1	4	4	Who does love a mini? I purchased this mini for my sister as a gift. She was always playing games on her little iPod and would look up from playing for a long time and would have to take a little time in getting her eyes to adjust back to normal. Anyone who loves to play games on their iPhone or iPod knows that is not always the easiest. Go get a mini and games become much more fun!My sister took her mini on vacation and was taking pictures of just about everything. And when she isn't taking pictures, she is playing a game (she's actually very good!). In fact, rarely does this mini leave her presence. I think we can call this a winner!	
671	4	4	4	0	4	0	4	4	1	2	4	4	Fast delivery and exactly what I expected! The title says it all.  I needed this iPad Mimi for my business and read other reviews, this was exactly what I needed.  I ordered it and it arrived within 3 days! Thank you!	
672	3	4	4	3	4	0	3	1	3	0	4	3	Great price for great tablet. This is my first tablet, so I can't say my rating is objective.  I've had an Android phone for about three years and wanted a tablet, but didn't want to do the i-thing and needed to wait until they were affordable.  Since I mainly planned on using it for an ereader (I knew I could get both the Kindle & Nook apps for it to be a universal reader), I didn't want to spend too much more than I would on a Nook or Kindle.  I'm still just figuring out how to make the most of it, but this has been a gem right out of the box for a first-time tablet user.	
673	0	3	4	2	1	4	1	4	1	4	4	3	Gift for a 10 year old. My son wanted a tablet for his birthday & he was working with about $200. I came across this tablet & on May 4th, it was listed at about $145. It had decent reviews & I expect him to use it for games & Youtube so I don't anticipate him running into the problems in the reviews.We ordered it along with an 8GB SD, a case & a 2 year drop & spill warranty from squaretrade. The smaller items came in the mail right away & the warranty is sent via email. The tablet shipped the 7th & we received it today, the 10th.This morning on Amazon's website, I noticed the tablet's price dropped to $117 and the warranty increased to $60. I don't know how the pricing works on amazon but I figured since the tablet ordered was directly through them that they would have a grace period to price match. I called & had no problem getting a $28 refund, I got a confirmation email for it right away (The rep said the policy for price match is about 2 weeks after purchase). GREAT Customer service. The price of the warranty wasn't an issue being that I ordered it at the lower price but wondering what caused the price to double? As far as the tablet goes, it works for what it was purchased for, games & Youtube. The web browsing worked fine. I don't like the GETJAR market (FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW, NO GOOGLE PLAY), so I downloaded Amazon Appstore.  The youtube videos are clear & don't drag. I think for a first tablet the function & quality are a STEAL at $117.I didn't see anyone mention that they also include a $10 music card for the emusic app.

I tried  Dolphin HD. I tried downloading Adobe Flash from 1mobile.com and other flash software. The borwser just displays the flash "cube" symbol but does not play the video.If I can get the links below to work I will have a truly fantastic tablet for a low price!For instanceI can not view the video links on these pages[...][...]Can not play the live audio feed on this page[...]But I can play videos on this page.[...]I had difficulty writing to the plug in SD card (32gig).In the comments that followed my post Harvey suggested I format the plug in SD card  as exFAT on a computer and try it again. I did as he suggested and formated the card as exFAT and it worked. I can now write to the SD card seen as extsd on the coby 7042-4.Coby should include this step in their documentation and on their web site to server their customers better.Apps2SD will not move software to /extsdThe comments that follow are from my original post and may not make sense now. I revised this post to save people the trouble of searching for the answer.Thanks to all who helped and Harvey who delivered the solution.	
677	3	4	4	4	4	2	1	4	3	4	3	4	Coby Kyros MID7042-4. This is a great tablet for the first time buyer.  Easy to use and holds its charge well. A great buy	
678	4	3	3	0	4	1	1	3	1	3	3	4	Not bad for the price. Good product, low price, fast shipping. Not an iPad, or even a Galaxy Tab, but to play, listen to music, read, watch videos on Youtube and check Twitter is perfect. Cons: The wireless is really poor, but you can connect a USB modem.	
679	4	0	4	4	4	4	1	0	0	4	3	3	So far so good... So far so good.. Except very small print on web sites, Old eyes not good for that, they say tap screen twice to enlarge image, works at times on some sites.. Battery life NOT even close to specs, you need to be wired to power to read a book for longer than 3-4 hours then recharge, they claim 11-hrs.. They probably had a long nap between start and finish.. WI-FI works well.. ebooks stored on MicroSD duplicate themselves in internal memory when read by onboard ALDIKO ereader app, making MicroSD useless for that function..This page indicates I am reviewing a Coby MID7024-4, What I got was Coby MID7033 sans camera, Not sure why I was asked to review MID7024-4..	
680	3	0	4	2	4	4	0	4	3	2	0	0	coby kyros 7" tablet. very disappointed.  am unable to order books from amazon as i thought i could.  tablet is sluggish and slow to respond.  a complete waste of time and money.	
681	1	4	4	1	3	4	4	4	1	1	2	3	decent tablet for the money. I would give 4 stars if it wasn't for the fact that amazon appstore does NOT work outside the US.  Got the Coby for my nephew that lives overseas and he cannot use amazon appstore (a much better android appstore than getjar) outside the US.WiFi performance is not the best.  Other than that, this is a good tablet for the money.  If I could install Google Play without installing a custom ROM (voiding the warranty) I would give this 5+ stars.	
682	2	0	4	4	4	0	1	3	0	2	1	4	disappointing. I bought this tablet for my 3 year old son so that I could have my Samsung back. I understand you get what you pay for... but I honestly don't even feel like I got my money's worth. It is built very cheaply and is very clunky in the way  it operates and works. It does not work with Netflix. I upgraded the android os, I added amazon appstore and the best I was able to do was get Netflix for a limited basis. Since this was my primary purpose for it, it did not meet my expectations. I will be spending the money to get him a Samsung tablet and it's quality.	
683	1	4	4	4	4	0	4	0	0	1	4	4	Excellent tablet for kids/me. This is my first tablet purchase. I was speculating a lot about buying iPad, but given that I wanted kids to use as they wanted and did not want to keep them telling to be careful because the device was too costly, I chose to buy this as it was much cheaper compared to iPad.Had to wait a week before it was finally delivered.Turned out that it was very good. Quality is nice and easy to get started with. I had to get hang of Android interface a little but in 1-2 days I am quite fluent with this.You will not be able to use play google on this as the device is not compliant, but Amazon apps and Get jar have got you covered enough, need not worry.Have loaded with lots of kids games and story books, most are available for free. Kids are just loving it from my younger daughter who plays piano on this to elder one(4 years) who does lot of gaming and story reading.Few reviews about this device are not good, I assume that those were incidental issues and not really the capability problem with device.I hope this review helps you. I suggest buying a case and 32 gb sd card with this.	
684	2	0	4	1	4	0	0	4	0	0	2	4	ok for inexpensive tablet. Wish the camera faced out too. Can only take pictures of your self :-( otherwise seems to work good  bought for Christmas for my 10 yr old so its a value I believe	
685	2	1	4	1	4	4	2	2	1	4	0	0	Junk! Spend the extra money and get a Kindle! Ordered this for our 9-year-old daughter. I charged it up and tried to upload some apps. None of the apps would load, they all kept failing. Also, the screen has poor lighting and poor pixilation - very spotty. It just feels light and cheap. Sending back right away and will just buy another Kindle for her instead.	
686	2	1	0	4	4	4	1	4	1	2	1	3	Not impressed. I bought this tablet for only one job. I use it to monitor an IP wireless security camera at our front door and feed the HDMI video to the 50 inch flat screen in our family room. It does the job nicely except for a couple of issues.It will run my IP CAM Viewer Basic application for 5 to 10 days and then it will freeze. I rebooted it a few times which is a nuisance but tolerable for the time being. The last time I rebooted it had lost the application. I had to download it again.I find the unit to be unfriendly to me. Normally on my other devices, I am happy with the touch performance and the OS layout. For example, after I down loaded the afore mentioned app, no icon appeared on the home page. I found it on the list of previous apps used. Haven't found out how to move to home page. I am sure it's simple but the operating manual is tiny with type that requires my old eyes to use a magnifying glass. It was the cheapest I found with HDMI output. It also has a limited app store compared to Google "Play Store".Curious to note, I have another 9" tablet monitor (Pandigital Novel R90L200) running the same app. It crashes on schedule every five days. The resistive touch screen seems primitive. I would never use it for anything except the monitor function. Almost unusable. But it was cheap. You get what you pay for. It also has four unmarked buttons at the bottom like other units but NO MARKING.I have another 7" tablet made by Lenovo Lenovo Ideapad A1 22282EU 7-Inch Tablet (Black), haven't used it much but seemed better than both above. It doesn't have an HDMI output.Will have to try Amazon's offerings.	
687	4	2	4	0	3	1	0	4	1	4	1	0	From OK to bad. You get what you pay for. I was in the market for a cheap tablet for entertainment purposes, thought the black Friday deal on this was quite a steal but boy was I wrong. I did not mind the whole Google Play missing dilemma as I found substitutes (Amazon Appstore and 1mobile market),the big problem was that less than a week into using it the DC power input already broke. Without a way to charge the device I had to send it back for a refund. I have never owned a device with such shoddy construction that it broke in less than a week of purchase. I would be cautious about purchasing this product if your looking for something reliable/longterm.	
688	3	4	2	1	4	4	4	1	2	3	3	4	Coby Kyros 7-Inch 4.0 ICS. This is actually a good tablet. Fit and finish were excellent. The android 4.0 ICS is really cool, easy to operate, and is very fast. I was able to install all the apps I needed from the Amazon app store. I even got Skype to work on it. Overall this is a great tablet to surf the web, listen to music, play games, and e-mail with. I actually had to send it back though due to a popping sound when I used ear phones. I tried 3 different pairs of ear phones and got the same result, so I sent it back. Overall a great product at a great price.	
689	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	0	3	0	4	4	android. nice item just the job, would recommmendit to any body, cant praise it enough evidently , would certainly buy another	
690	1	4	2	2	1	0	1	1	1	1	2	0	Need more Apps. Can't get Google Play Apps and have trouble with Amazon Apps Store as well!  Getjar doesn't provide enough free apps for our purpose.	
691	2	4	2	3	1	3	4	4	1	1	1	3	No more Amazon App store. Thanks to new compatibility issues, owing to updates to the Amazon App Store, they are no longer compatible.  You can't use the Amazon App store on this tablet (the 7042).  You are stuck with Get Jar (which is lame beyond belief).  After getting this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas, it's a paperweight.  So, I'm returning it, and I'll find another tablet.	
692	4	4	3	0	3	3	3	2	0	4	3	3	Coby Kryos 7inch tablet 4.0 4gb 16:9 capacitive. I like my tablet. It is easier to travel with and convenient most times.  I still have not learn to us all the good features on it.  I am learning.  Once I do,  I will love it.	
693	4	1	1	4	1	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	Do NOT buy this product. Buying this tablet is by far the worst purchase I have ever made. It was such a waste of money! This tablet never worked properly. It has reset itself to factory settings, for no apparent reason, at least four times now. You can't download Google play or the istore on it, which limits the apps you can get by a lot. It freezes all the time and will not unfreeze without a restart. I've tried. I left it for 5 hours once and it stayed frozen the entire time. The battery doesn't hold charge for very long, and it takes forever to recharge. The camera is really crappy, and it doesn't have much memory. It doesn't like it when you play games. I've never been able to get Angry Birds to work properly on it. And don't even think about netflix or youtube or skype. It won't download netflix and if you try using the others, it will throw a complete hissy fit and won't work for days. It even has a hard time with facebook!I don't have the highest standards when it comes to electronics. I don't even have a smartphone (yet). I'm perfectly happy with middle-of-the-road stuff because I don't want to pay the high prices. But this tablet isn't even mediocre. It's abysmal. How it ever passed any sort of testing is beyond me. Take my advice. Take your money elsewhere. The low price is not worth the headache!	
694	2	3	1	3	2	1	0	0	0	3	2	4	great BUT PLEASE LET HAVE SOME MOST USED APP LIKE FACEBOOK AND SOME MORE. I know it is a budget tablet. I bought it and found it has no android google market. FINE. I went to amazon app and surfed for a while. Downloaded netflix. Tried to download facebook, don't find. My opinion is let there be some most used free apps. Bottom line is lot of people when buying budget tablets seek these free apps and recommend between friends. You don't need to have professional apps. At least let there be some free apps which half of the world are using. Not finding it in amazon or getjar apps is frustating. Now i have to root the tablet.	
695	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	1	0	4	4	Coby Kyros 10.1 Tablet. I'm happy to have bought this product thanks to the many reviews listed on Amazon. This tablet is very light weight and easy to handle making book reading a pleasure. Downloads so far are almost effortless a must for a non computer buff like me. The only problem so far is the calendar app on tablet won't sync. I can only hope Coby comes up with a fix or update.	
696	2	2	3	2	2	3	0	0	4	2	0	0	STAY AWAY! Like most people, I didn't want to spend $250 for a tablet, so I thought "Ok, let me go with something that has decent reviews, but is cheaper."  I wanted a tablet, because I want to check and respond to emails quickly, so I can use two hands, like I'm on a desktop/laptop, instead of a smartphone.  Voilà - I buy the Coby Kyros 10.1!  I was really excited to get this as it's my first tablet!  However, my excitement turned to pure frustration the FIRST DAY of using it!I type quite fast and at some point the keyboard could not keep up with me! I had to WAIT for the tablet!  I thought, "let me not get too critical", so I gave it another chance.I only wanted a tablet to check email - that's it! I didn't want to get any apps, download anything...simply check email! And it couldn't even do that! I went to Starbucks to get online and even though I was INSIDE Starbucks, the signal did not reach full strength!  But I was calm, because it still worked.  However, I wasn't able to check my email through the 'email app' (included when getting the tablet), so I had to go through the proper channels (ie; getting to yahoo, signing in, etc).  This just wasted more time! Of course, the "typing lapse" continued.  In the end, I ended up spending more time dealing with this tablet issue than even CHECKING email!I let my sister borrow it to see if maybe I was doing something wrong.  No, it wasn't me; it was definitely the tablet!  Within 2 weeks, I was done!!The BEST PART to this story is that Amazon took care of my refund AMAZINGLY! I was able to obtain a free shipping label and was refunded my full amount! Thank you, Amazon, for turning this sour situation into a happy ending.So while I'm still on the hunt for a tablet, I'm just glad I didn't lose my money with this mistake.	
697	0	3	1	1	2	1	1	0	4	4	0	2	Wtf. My son just got this yesterday and already this so much going wrong. At just 35% battery it flashes off and on continusly I haven't fully charged it yet but that can't be normal. Google play won't download and google plus keeps crashing as soon as it opens. The app center that comes on there barely have anything, Netflix took two times to download it on here. I hate that there is only a front camera so I guess he can only take pics of himself. I am so irked, I hope this is just a defected one which is still bad but this can't be as good as it get.	
698	4	4	0	4	4	4	3	4	0	4	3	2	So far, I like it. The first week i bought this tablet and uploaded my pdf textbooks, it started freezing. So far, Aldiko, used for reading has close unexpectedly like 20 times. The wifi is so so weak, that i was beside another person with an ipad, he has internet through his wifi and I can't; that sucks. The camera is poor, but i dnt care. As long as it doesnt freeze frequently while i'm reading im good. Overall, this tablet is nt a good choice at all, save money and get and ipad or something better than this. Trust me, dnt go for it.UPDATE: Althought I posted an angry comment about this tablet, but so far I only need it for my pdf and its really serving the purpose. The amazing part is the flash drive port that it has and ipad doesn't; gave it a plus over IpadUPDATE 2:Since I updated my ES file explorer, this  tablet have been doing just fine. Now I can watch youtube, and go to any website and watch movies without closing unexpectedly. The main problem was Getjar that acts like google play store. After the update I got rid of getjar and install Mobomarket. The tablet is working just fine, and with so many cool android app on mobomarket, it makes your tablet brand new. Now I have google map unlike before. I downloaded and updated all necessary apps. Bottom line, the update to my ES file explorer change everything.

700	2	4	0	3	2	4	4	4	3	1	2	4	Solid entry level tablet for kids. Let's get this out of the way: average tablet, average score. It's not a Nexus 7 or a Kindle Fire.That said, it's got pretty solid but plastic-y build quality, and the screen is remarkably responsive. The GetJar app store is passable, and the Amazon App Store is worth far more, but what counts is whether you can get the Android Play Store on it, and I'm happy to report that you can.It's a little involved, and I wouldn't recommend it for people that are scared of command line windows, but with a small amount of effort you can have a great little Android 4.0 tablet with full Play Store access. There's an entire thread on it at AndroidTablets.net and the step by step instructions have been posted: [...]You can play Minecraft PE and it works perfectly. No problems with video playback and I can give the kids more storage space by popping in an SD card. I haven't tried Netflix yet, but that should work. I think we'll be plenty good for a preschooler and a kindergartener...older kids would be better suited with a more full-featured tablet.

Almost the same response I've gotton everytime I've called. Below is my orignal review:I usually don't review products I've bought. However I thought I'd share my experience with Coby tablet repairs. The speakers quit working on my Coby tablet after 32 days Amazon couldn't help because more than 30 days had passed. I called Coby and was told repairs would be less than 30 days. I returned the tablet to Coby they recevied it on 10-9-2012 today is 12-12 2012. I started calling Coby once a week after 30 days their reply has always been the same; tablet was shipped 2 days ago. I called today 62 days after I returned the tablet for a less than 30 day repair and got their usual reply the tablet shipped 2 days ago. If you buy a Coby product and need factory service I hope your experence is better than mine.

703	3	4	0	4	3	4	1	1	4	3	3	4	Tablet. This came next day and it is perfect. I have bought it for my 5 year old as an alternative to the kids version. It connects to the internet, I have google play installed and have got a few educational apps ready for him. It is brilliant for him and he is going to love this on Christmas day.

706	3	4	3	1	4	3	4	3	3	4	3	4	So far, so good. So far I really like this little tablet.  True, it doesn't have the bells and whistles that some of them do, but that's why it's so affordable!  It works great for sending e-mail, surfing online and reading books when near a mobile hot spot.  Takes a decent picture too!	
707	4	4	4	4	2	0	1	2	4	3	4	4	Nice tablet. We have purchaced sefveral of these tablets over the past year.  They make good gifts for frends and family.  be aware that these are not made for taking photos, as the camera only faces toward the screen, and is ment more for video chatting.	
708	2	2	4	3	2	4	4	4	0	3	3	4	Nice performance and great value. Got this to replace a Kyros 1125 whose touchscreen was ruined by absentmindedly leaving it for a month in an airtight sleeve right by an open window during summer.  The 1125 had been my workhorse tablet and this looks to be a good replacement. I appreciate the full-sized usb slot added, and having the latest version of the Android OS is great.The frame of the 1125 seemed a bit more durable as the 1042 has a more plastic-like finish in its construction, but that appears to makes it lighter and that is useful for a 10-inch tablet.  The loss of the 1125's various fixed button controls on the face-frame is no big deal as I often pressed them by accident when changing grips while reading.Resolution is not the greatest, but it works very well as a comic reader.  Perfect Viewer was quite fast in both display and taking in a large collection of comics, so the machine does not feel underpowered at all.Aldiko and other useful apps come pre-installed.  No significant bloat.As warning to prospective buyers, while Coby tablets lack the official Google apps and marketplace, the 1125 Kyros could easily have these added by just installing a few files, without need for rooting or any tinkering with the OS.  The 1042 however cannot install Google Play, the Gmail app, etc with similar ease.  I tested instead the GetJar app marketplace offered and found it quite lacking.  Several favorite apps that I had read GetJar carried could however not be found.  Sure, you can get Angry Birds, but no Perfect Viewer, no Cool Reader.  But the Amazon marketplace installed without problem, and so did the SlideMe and GoodeReader markets, so I could get all the free apps I sought.Navigation of the file system is a bit clumsy.  Unlike in my Coby Kyros 7 incher, the file manager did not show me in easy to access fashion the contents of my slotted 16GB SD card.  I had to go and look for it in the "mnt" folder.  Once the apps had the path saved it proved no problem anymore, but I wonder if my having just moved over the card from my older 1125 without cleaning its contents cause that.  Anyway, you have to go up the folders path but you can access the card, just know that it will shown as "extsd" in "mnt".More comments to follow as I work more with it.	
709	1	3	2	2	2	1	4	3	2	1	2	0	Good For Price, Bad Support. Tiny reset button easily missed. I give it 3 stars because it seems to work great for the price. I replaced my Kindle Fire for this just to get Flash and other Android Apps. It loses a star because it doesn't access the Google Play store, but I found most of the free apps I was looking for on the Good E-Reader App store and some good paid apps on the Amazon Apps store.It loses another star because the tech support is lousy. After a week of using the tablet, it shut itself down (despite having a full charge) and wouldn't power up or reset when I followed the manual trouble shooting instructions. I replaced it with Amazon's return policy, and had the same symptoms a week after getting a replacement. Ready to give up, I called the customer support from the manufacturer, and they didn't have a clue. What neither the phone customer support rep nor the manual mentioned is that there's a tiny paperclip reset button on the side next to the HDMI port. It fixed my power problem. It was mentioned on their website, but it should have been in the manual and the phone support rep should have known about it. I shouldn't have had to keep digging for that answer.The Amazon App store is buggy on it. The Apps purchased from the store seem to periodically uninstall themselves randomly, causing you to have to re-download them. Every time I exited it or shut down the tablet, the App interphase disappears. I had to clear the data and re-register just to get it working again.  And then I had to manually delete the old registrations from my Amazon account online. One good thing about the bug, the purchased apps work despite the disappearing app store interphase problem, which was fine with me because there is no way to sign out of the app store or restrict my kids from purchasing apps once I've registered. I found that an older version of the Amazon app store worked on the tablet, but still didn't have a feature allowing users to sign out, so I re-installed the version with the disappearing app store interphase bug, just to keep my kids from purchasing apps. Amazon needs to fix both the disappearing interphase problem and include a feature to either sign out or restrict the purchasing of apps. The way the store works now, it only restricts existing in-app purchasing, but not the purchasing of new apps.	
710	0	0	1	2	4	4	0	4	1	4	2	1	Not what I thought I was getting/I no longer own this item. it was returned. I say that because being new to buying tablets and being on a low budget I am afraid I have bit off more than I wanted to.  I need a tablet because I am out and about and sometimes to have access to the internet. I am a shoe distributor and would like to order on the spot sometimes rather than having to go home to email my orders.I also like to download certain apps for idle time, and this tablet does not have google play, and the Getjar is so limited.  Also I thought the tablet that I ordered had the ice cream operating system on it. Did I misread the information?	
711	2	3	2	2	2	3	4	1	2	1	1	0	unsatisfied, theJetjar app store with this tablet was terrible didn't have any of the apps i was looking for  The tablet was not  compatiable with any other app stores.In the Q&A; Thy recommanded contacting the manufacturer I couldn't do anything with the app to download books.Also when ever i turned it on the camera would come on. This is the last try i ordered the kindle fire HD and im hoping for something much better.....	
712	0	3	3	2	4	4	3	1	2	2	4	4	Great Christmas Gift. I got this tablet for my 9 year old son for Christmas and he loves it.  Nice product, good sound and plays all of the games that he needs.  It does not use the Google Play store, but it still has lots of games in the GetJar store for him to play.Nice tablet for the price.	
713	2	4	4	4	4	2	4	4	2	0	3	4	Christmas gift. Got this for my father in law for Christmas he likes it very much a little hard to navigate at first but a good tablet would recommend it.	
714	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	4	Great little tablet. This tablet has worked perfectly since I got it. It's easy to use and I'm still enjoying exploring it. Long lasting battery.  I highly recommend reading the suggestions offered by some of the very helpful & knowledgable users who comment on this product.  Yes I got googleplay, bookbub, and love 1mobile.com	
715	4	4	1	1	4	4	4	4	0	4	1	4	coby kyros. Its ok for a starter tablet....but not worth the money! I expected more for the amount...will do more research next time.	
716	2	3	2	0	2	4	2	0	4	3	1	4	not so good. The upper part of the screen has less sensitivity and I have a hard time for it to respond to the touch. It came with no headphones and the battery life needs improvement. I don't like that it doesn't have the google marketplace to download apps, but I already knew that before the purchase, however I decided to give it a try and very often the service is not available.

Hi, the Coby Kyros MID7048 is  a great tablet, but as you know it is a lack  about the possibility of install google play store, well I will tell you how to root (it's something like jailbreaking) your tablet (it is a very easy process) and install automatically google play store on your device : )First of all download this file:[...]Connect your coby MID7048 to your PC in USB mode, then copy the file downloaded file "update" to the root directory of the tablet. Disconnect from your PC.Then in your tablet go to:Settings > About tablet > System updates > Install system update > From internal storage > Install nowThen your tablet will shutting down and installs automatically the update.The final step when it finish is select  (with the power button of the tablet) the option "Reboot system now" and that is all, your tablet is rooted and the google play is installed in your apps when the tablet restart.Enjoy it!This process applies too to Coby Kyros MID7034, MID7036, MID8048, models.	
718	2	1	2	4	3	1	1	4	4	1	3	4	no good game app. Nice tablet, but I couldn't download the Google store app, so I returned it. I suggest that Google store app be accessible.	
719	3	4	4	4	1	1	4	3	4	0	2	3	Tablet. It's a good tablet, just a little hard to use for kids. The screen display is grainy, but overall a good use.	
720	4	3	4	4	4	0	0	4	0	4	4	4	She LOVES It!! I bought this for my wife mainly to put her scriptures on it.  She can't handle the books with her scriptures anymore due to the weight and the thickness of the volumes.  She has arthritis in her hands so we had to do something.  Well this was the right thing to do!  She LOVES it!!!  It does the job that she expected it to do!	
721	4	3	4	3	4	4	0	3	4	3	4	4	Great Tablet. I bought this tablet for my husband and he is so happy with it.  I showed him how to use it and he is able to use it without my help.  Great produce and the price was so reasonable.	
722	3	1	1	4	3	0	4	0	3	0	3	0	Like it. Bought this to replace a MID 7034-4. For  a few extra bucks, the quality is much superior. Don't waste your time with resistive screens.	
723	4	1	4	4	0	2	1	3	4	3	2	4	Was Screwed on the price. I purchased this tablet on Jan. 18 for $173.09 and now you're selling it for $162.99. If you wish to keep your customers you should give them a rebate matching the lower price. This is wrong and you shouldn't treat customers this way. It's deceptive and shouldn't be allowed. It's only been 15 days since I bought it and I received it on the 25th. All you've done is make me think of going elsewhere to purchase any further tablets I may be in the market for.Coby Kyros 9.7-Inch Android 4.0 8 GB Internet Tablet 4:3 Capacitive Multi-Touchscreen with Built-In Camera, Black MID9740-8

726	4	2	3	2	4	3	4	1	4	4	4	4	Coby Kyros Android Tablet. Love this product. I take it wherever I go, if I'm going to have to wait at an appointment, etc, to play games and skype and all kinds of other apps. Excellent product. Rivals the iPad even if I can't get the special apps that you can get with the iPad. Very enjoyable and works great.	
727	1	2	2	0	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	4	WON'T TURN BACK ON! I ordered this for my husband for christmas. It was an ok size and we chose it because of the camera. He didn't use it often and lately the battery started dying really quickly and now it won't even turn on. Not even on the charger....	
728	4	3	4	4	2	3	4	0	4	4	3	4	Colby Kyros 8 inch Android. I really like my new tablet but I'm still learning how to use all the things it will do.  I find it so much easier to read books than on my Kindle.  The light is better the screen is larger and I love just tapping to turn the page.  Thank you	
729	0	3	4	3	2	4	4	0	1	3	4	4	Good price and good quality. This tablet is very good, fast and friendly, has a good webcam, the WIFI system is fast, the touch widescreen is perfect, I like this tablet, light and small, and at the same time excellent picture and performance, has micro sd and mini USB input, doesn't have google play or android market, but you can root the tablet and install it.	
730	0	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	4	Tablet. I love it! It works for my daughter and fiance. I mean the processing speed is slow to load everything but all around it's great!!!	
731	2	3	4	4	1	3	0	0	1	1	1	0	The price says it all. The price shows its quality. Customer service doesn't exist. Its not compatible with google play. In order for it to be so you have to root it and good luck doing that. Its near impossible because you cant access the boot sector like you normally should. Its a pain in the butt. The screen cracked within a month of purchase and all it took was a simple flick of the wrist. Cheap construction. A total bummer. Icecream sandwhich is a plus. But if you want quality look elsewhere.	
732	4	4	4	4	4	3	0	4	4	1	3	4	Great little tablet. Not an Ipad of course, but it will do! Great for games, nice sized screen, and works very well! Glad we bought it	
733	0	2	0	3	0	4	2	1	0	4	0	0	I hated this. It sucked it crashed 4 times in 3 days . i Sent it back it was not as good as i thought it would be. It would not work with Google Play instead it used Getjar which sucks and doesnt have that many apps.	
734	1	0	1	0	3	4	3	3	2	0	2	4	It's fine. It's pretty much what I expected BUT the touch screen is not very sensative.  Sometimes I have to sit there and tap on it about 5 to 10 times in the same spot before it recognizes that Im even trying to do something.	
735	4	4	4	3	4	0	2	4	4	4	4	4	EXCELLENT PRODUCT. THANK YOU VERY GRATEFUL TO THE PRODUCT. 100% RECOMMENDED. GOOD CARE AND SAFETY.WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE housings and linings for this tablet.	
736	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	3	4	0	4	4	Good unit for the cost! I previously had a 7" with only 2.3 OS until it was broken recently.  Found this larger tablet which is an improvement for screen size, not to mention having the latest 4.0 OS!  Haven't really found anything negative about it other than difficulty getting a cover/stand for it.  Finally located the only cover made to fit which is sold exclusively on Amazon for just $14!  It is an excellent case and highly necessary to protect this tablet.  I don't understand why the only large tablets are Ipads, Samsungs, Acers, etc. at $400 plus, then the Coby for $150 or less, and they are all using the same OS and many similar parts.  Sure, the Ipad and Samsung probably operate considerably faster in some applications, but really, to play some games, take some pics, and surf the net I will gladly sacrifice a couple seconds per function by saving $300 + dollars!!!  Considering how easily these tablets can be broken I can't afford the risk.	
737	1	3	4	4	4	2	1	4	4	4	3	4	Good bang for the buck. I'm new to the tablet world and this unit seems to do everything I want from it right now.  Can't beat the price.	
738	3	0	4	4	3	2	3	4	4	2	3	4	Perfect for portable entertainment. I bought this as a gift and my sister loved it. It is just the right size and is perfect for portable entertainment and checking e-mails.	
739	2	2	3	0	3	2	3	1	1	4	1	0	Has issues. GetJar apps don't work and the fact that it constantly says "Use Precise Location" and you cannot is beyond irritating.	
740	4	4	4	3	4	1	3	4	1	3	4	4	great. as always worried about buying online but this is a great buy for the performance that i getwould buy again	
741	1	2	0	2	3	2	2	4	0	1	1	1	I guess my idea of a good Android was wrong. I found out the Camera among other functions are not great. I would have returned it, but I will end up spending too much on mailing. I had to pay for mailing to me, I mailed it to its destination , and it has to be mailed back to me to be mailed to Amazon. That is not worth the struggle. I may as well just count my losses on that one.	
742	1	4	3	0	4	3	0	0	3	4	2	0	The battery life is short. The function was OK, it allows you download some useful software, but the battery life is terrible. The battery of the product that I purchased was dead within 3 month. One day, I forgot to charge and it completely ran out of power, when I tried to recharge it, it just can not be charge anymore. In the fact, the machine was dead. I had to send it to repair now.	
743	4	4	4	4	4	1	4	0	2	0	4	4	excellent. excellent product I recommend it 100% is what is actually described, besides that is unique, I found it excellent, very good	
744	2	0	2	0	3	0	4	2	1	4	2	0	It's not the tablet you need to be aware of it is the manufacturer customer service. I am surprised Amazon partners with a company that does not support it's products.  I bought my Coby Kyros in October 2012.  The screen froze so I sent it in for replacement April 11, 2013.  There are only 2 numbers to call 99% of the time you get a busy signal.  It cost me $30 to send it back. Over $15 to ship it to them and a $15 money order so they could send it back.  They tell it takes 6-8 weeks to get the replacement.  It is now June 13 and I have not been able to get through on the phone for over a month to check the status of it.  The only day of the week I have been able to get through is a Monday and had to sit on hold forever.Honestly I loved my tablet and miss it greatly but I would never by another Coby Kyros because of the lack of customer service.  The product is great while it works, but you might as well kiss it goodbye if you have to send it in for a replacement.If you don't believe me try calling these numbers to see if you get through: 1-800-681-2629  or 1-800-727-3592.Best of luck to those who still wish to buy, but to someone who doesn't have money and time to lose keep shopping.If you do decide to get it; the best free app stores to use with this were Amazon and Mobile1 app store.Get Jar was a joke. Hulu Plus did not work on it but Netflix did.  You do not get 4 GB of space for Apps, App space is very minimal and even with a 16 GB SD card still was pretty limited.  I would by more hard core memory because there are quite a few apps you can't send to the SD card.	
745	4	2	3	1	2	3	2	4	0	0	0	0	Low quality charger and doesn't charge via usb. I should have known better before buying a cheap product. The charger doesn't work after 2 weeks. And you cannot charge it using the USB cable.  Waste of money.	
746	3	4	3	3	2	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	Fantastic for photographers who want to share pictures. I'm a photographer who wanted an easy and inexpensive ($99) way to share my images with other photographers and friends.  This tablet fills the bill perfectly.  The screen is very sharp, realistically colorful, and my images look just as good as those on my desktop monitor.If you want a tablet that does everything as well as an iPad does.. buy an iPad.  But if you want an inexpensive, portable, and high-quality photo viewer.. this tablet is for you.

748	2	2	3	1	2	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	Super Pleased. I received  this tablet in 2 days via "Prime".  It's a relly good tablet.  I purchased one for my granddaughters last Christmas and because I was so pleased with it, this was my 2nd purchase a giveawy item on my YouTube channel.  The person who won this tablet loves it and my granddaughters became so obsessed with it that I put it away temporarly. The picture quality is 5, sound 4, speed 5, apps. 5 although there is no "google play" , battery life is 5 and finally the camera and video are a 3.5 rating. Well if it helps to know,  I have a galaxy and the camera and video are 3.5 (lol)  which isn't a big deal for me.Super happy with both purchases :)	
749	0	3	3	4	4	4	3	0	0	0	3	4	Works well for me. I wanted a cheap tablet with a large screen for reading comics/books and general surfing.  I wasn't expecting Play to be available, so I knew that going in.  1Mobile had what I needed.After rooting, mainly to remove bloatware, surfing is very quick using UC browser.Short version, if you don't mind getting your hands dirty, this tablet can surpass your expectations.

I called Amazon and I was two days short of the return policy. Well Amazon was going to let me return it, but since I had an extended warranty, I chose to send it back to CobyUSA instead.  It arrived at their Warehouse on April 19th (I had tracking on it).  I have not seen it since.  Wasted my money on this horrible product.  I will NEVER purchase another Coby product again!  I have called Customer Service daily every week since - for 5 months!  Every week I get the run around, I have even been dealing with a Manager who is worthless.  I have called Corporate three or four times to complain about the customer service, no one has even called me or emailed me back.  I would BEG Amazon to stop selling this product since their service is so bad.  OOO WELL that's what I get for buying a Cheep Tablet.  I would of been better off purchasing Amazon's Kindle Fire.

It will come on and as soon as it displays "android" it shuts off.  Tried resetting it according to instructional manual but it still doesn't work.  I have called Coby's technical support # in the owner's manual time after time and all you get is a recording to go to their website.  I did this and I have sent several emails to them to find out where and to whom to return the tablet to since it is still under warranty.  To this date, I have not received a response.  So beware Coby does not stand behind their products.I would not recommend buying this product to anyone and sorry I did.

754	0	0	2	1	3	1	1	3	2	4	0	0	Poor customer service from Coby. I bought this tablet in December 2012 as a gift for my daughter. Two months after receiving it, the part where you plug it in to charge just caved in. I called Coby and they said I could send it to get repaired for free, just send a $15 money order so they could ship it back. I followed their instructions, and sent the tablet in March. It's now October, and I still haven't gotten my tablet back. I've called several times but every time I call I get a different story. It's always some lame excuse, followed by "Your tablet will get back to you within a few weeks". 5 times now that "few weeks" has passed without my tablet coming back. If you are thinking about buying this, just take a look at Coby Electronics facebook page. [...] It's so bad they had to make it so people couldn't comment on their page. But read the comments posted on ANY of their posts. My problem with the company is not just a fluke....Don't buy this. You are better off spending a little more on something from a more reputable company. I lost out on the $100 I payed for it, the $15 I spent shipping it back to them, and the $15 I sent with it so they could ship it back.	
755	3	2	0	2	2	4	2	1	1	0	1	1	disappointed. I bought this for my son back in February 2013 as his first tablet.  After a while, we started to get long delays on start up, and apps would either take a long time to open, or sometimes we would need to start all over again.  "The app is not responding...would you like more time" was a common message.  It then stopped working in November 2013.  We will try to get it replaced on warranty, if there even is a 1 year warranty for it.  If not, then I am really disappointed with my son's experience on his first tablet, which I do feel we paid a reasonable amount for.

Jan 14, 2013: i have used it a bit, and i've noticed that it tends to freeze. the apps don't run well, and the app options in getjar are soooo limited it's not even funny. when watching movies or clips and i have to stop it mid way, to continue watching it i would most definitely have to restart the entire tablet. you can download an app from amazon to transfer apps to your sd card, which is great, because the internal memory is very limited. the battery lasts about 5 hrs watching movies, or just being active. if you can, put an extra few bucks to a better brand.April 15, 2013: Sooo, I have had this product for about 3 months now. and it has totally stopped working. Tried to get in touch with the seller and they were uncooperative. Not to mention the manufacturer! I called them and after about an hour on the phone they're telling me about shipping it out. Not only do I have to pay to ship it out, also send a money order for return shipping. Don't even BOTHER with this PRODUCT! It is still sitting in my house to be shipped out.	
757	0	3	3	2	2	3	4	2	4	1	3	3	Good buy for the price. Overall I like the tablet, I've had it for over a week now and no major issues with it yet. The inability to have GooglePlay does somewhat make me regret my choice as I was hoping for an ability to do documents on the go (and some of my favorite apps for such are on GooglePlay), but still, Google has though of this already and on GetJar it does allow for the App "Google Docs" which allows you with a single click to access the Google drive.There has also been an issue that when I plug it into the computer with the included USB to USB2.0, it keeps forgetting that its plugged in on the computer's end. It stopped transfers to it saying that it couldn't be found and then by the time I was halfway through reading the message my computer would giver me the pop up of New Hardware found. An SD card solved this problem handily. the eReader is a little twitchy, but once you get to know it's quirks, it works well. Overall, it is a good machine for my intentions and I would buy it again.

I bought the product and the store sent me a defective factory after you make a claim only for the product to match the U.S. level, and the customer loses money transfers to another country again this product is worth almost $ 170 and I have to spend more than $ 200 because the store is not responsible, being responsible for sending them a faulty product ... I do not recommend buying at this store because

I've had this coby 9.7 5 hours and it froze up on me 3 times, then it had to reset it self to factory setting, don't know why that came about, and lost everything I had put on there and had it set the way I wanted. This is incredibly cheap crap and I am sending it back today. If you don't mine having to keep rebooting, freezing up then this is the way to go, battery lasted only 4 hours and when it's low and on the charger you still can't get it work, you have to have 15% on the battery plus the charger but the charger won't keep up, you will still lose battery life. You you like throwing money away, then this is the product to do it on.	
760	1	3	4	4	0	4	3	2	4	4	0	0	Sitting in my draw! Not worth the money. The battery dosen't last long, the system freezes all the time, it takes forever to process, the system freezes all the time, can't run too many aps at the same time, the system freezes all the time, and by the way, did I mention the system freezes all the time. Ihave been trying to give it away, so if anyone wants one, let me know. My wife wouldn't take it. I had to buy her an iPad as well.	
761	4	4	4	4	4	0	0	4	4	4	0	4	Not happy with this. No happy at all with the Coby Kyros.  I should have read all of the comment and I would not have purchased it.	
762	3	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	Super thin (but powerful) with Android 4.0! This little tablet delivers! I had Visual Land's first tablet, the Connect, which worked great for what I wanted to use it for, but wasn't very keen on the way it looked. Their newest tablet has the same guts but with a nip/tuck job that made it much better looking. And this time it's got Android 4.0 under the hood to boot! So I gave the Connect to my sister and bought this one for myself! :DPrimary Usage- E-book/Comic Book Reading- Addictive Games (GLWG, Fruit Ninja, Heaven & Hell, etc.)- Skype/Video Calling- Portable HD Video Player / YouTubePros- Android 4.0- Slim, Portable Size- HDMI Out- 8GB Storage- Multiple Colors- Decent Battery LifeCons- No Google Play- No BluetoothThis is the first tablet I've seen available with Android 4.0.  I saw a couple others saying they did but reading that tricky fine print, it's a future upgrade. Ice Cream Sandwich is on this baby right out of the box.  I missed the Honeycomb (3.0) band-wagon, but have read it's similar.  The previous tablet and my phone were both Gingerbread (2.3), so this is definitely like a shiny new toy for me.  I like being able to multi-task between programs. I like how 4.0 works much like a regular PC OS.This tablet's much sleeker than their previous one, looking like it went through a 12-step weight loss program.  It's super thin...probably the thinnest tablet out there. My boyfriend can actually fit it in his front pocket.  I'm actually surprised how much they were able to cram into this thing with how thin it is.  They have the usual headphone, mini USB and DC ports, a MicroSD card slot and a built-in mic.  Like their previous tablet, they have a mini HDMI out port, but sadly, still no Bluetooth.  There's a front camera and the speaker is in the back.  The housing is plastic but it's got a very nice look and feel to it. And it comes in a variety colors (I have the purple one).There's no Google Play (Market), but then again, Google seems to reject anybody in this price range from joining their "club". GetJar is pre-installed and I installed Amazon Appstore and 1Mobile which are working perfectly.This tablet is the perfect size for reading ebooks and comics.  It sits in my hand comfortably, like a small hardcover. Kindle, Comixology and MangaZoo run smoothly. The capacitive screen on this responds well to touch.  Very responsive without being too sensitive.  Even worked perfectly well with the factory protector still on.  Colors look crisp and clear when watching HD videos. The multi-touch works well too, as I've been playing Fruit Ninja with no issues at all in responsiveness to pretty much noobing it, dragging my whole hand across the screen.Speaking of games, I've got quite a few on here already and almost all of them run smoothly.  The single core processor is pretty powerful and the 512MB of RAM definitely help make this thing speedy. There seems to be a small issue of the accelerometer working properly with some racing games but I have a feeling it might be a 4.0 issue and not a tablet issue as that doesn't seem to be an issue outside of games.  I got caught up in saving the world in GLWG for about 4 hours, so the battery life is definitely impressive.As I mentioned earlier HD videos play great, and look great.  The MicroSD slot supports at least 32GB cards (hoping to get a 64GB one soon), which I've got loaded up with videos.  YouTube and TED videos playback perfectly. Netflix has a bit of a problem with picture and sound syncing, but reading feedback, sounds like an app problem they're working on fixing.  I love having the HDMI out port, as I often snatch videos from YouTube to watch later on my TV.  Also great for turning a TV into a monitor especially when you hook up a wireless mouse/keyboard (yup it's supported) through the USB port (they even provide the OTG cable...so thoughtful of them) and voila...instant PC.I love using a tablet for Skype, as it's small enough to be as convenient as carrying a cell phone versus a laptop that you have to hold upright and usually with 2 hands if you're walking around while chatting it up.  The camera is pretty decent, even in low light conditions. And the mic picks up sound very well. Right now there's an issue with Skype and 4.0 so I've been using Fring which works just as well.For those who are tech savvy, this tablet is rooted.  And there are already people out there making their own scripts and mods to fix those little issues and tweak better performance for tablets with the same chipset as this one.  I've tried a couple (turned off the mobile network signal for better battery life, unlocked Google Play, etc.) and they work great.For a sub $200 tablet, this is one to keep an eye on.  As the first I've seen with Android 4.0 and it's super thin design, it's absolutely a worthy entry to the tablet market.UPDATED (now that I have a Kindle Fire)----------------------------------------------I've had the Prestige 7 for about a month now and finally got a Kindle Fire about 2 weeks ago (when they dropped it to $139 for a special deal).  You can't really compare the Prestige 7 to an iPad or an ASUS Transformer or such...they're different beasts...just like you can't compare a peach to a plum.  There's a reason you pay $300 more for those, whether it's a quad core CPU or paying for a brand name stamped on the back.  The Kindle Fire isn't exactly the same as the Prestige 7 either...it's kinda like a peach to an apricot.  The CPU comparisson changes the game.  But they're similar in size and in the same price range so I guess it's pretty natural to size up the 2 against each other.  So let's look at how they stand side-by-side.SizeKindle Fire: 7.5" x 4.7" x 0.45" 14.6 oz.Prestige 7: 7.5" x 4.7" x 0.4" 10.5 oz.ScreenKindle Fire: 7" Capacitive Multi-Touch (1024x600)Prestige 7: 7" Capacitive Multi-Touch (800x480)CPUKindle Fire: OMAP Dual Core ARM A9 + 512MB RAMPrestige 7: Cortex-A8 Single Core + 512MB RAMStorageKindle Fire: 8GB + no expandable card slotPrestige 7: 8GB + MicroSDHC card slotBatteryKindle Fire: about 8 hours continuous reading; 4 hours to chargePrestige 7: about 6-8 hours continuous reading; 2 hours to chargePortsKindle Fire: USB (micro; charge/connect to computer)Prestige 7: USB (mini; OTG + charge/connect to computer), DC Power, Mini HDMI (1080p output)Wireless ConnectivityKindle Fire: WiFi 802.11 b/g/nPrestige 7: WiFi 802.11 b/g/n, supports 3G dongleAudioKindle Fire: 3.5mm stereo audio, dual speakers on sidePrestige 7: 3.5mm stereo audio, speaker on backContent Formats SupportedKindle Fire: Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively, Audible (Audible Enhanced (AA, AAX)), DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, non-DRM AAC, MP3, MIDI, OGG, WAV, MP4, VP8Prestige 7: MP3, WMA, OGG, AAC, M4A, FLAC, APE, 3GP, WAV, AVI, MKV, WMV, MOV, MP4, MPG, FLV, JPG, GIF, BMP, PNG, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PDF, TXT, AZW (Kindle app can be installed), Audible (Audible app can be installed)Included in the BoxKindle Fire: Kindle Fire Device, Power Adapter, Quick Start GuidePrestige 7: Prestige 7 Tablet, Power Adapter, OTG Cable, USB Cable, Headphones, User ManualThe main reason I went with the Prestige 7 (P7) first is the exact reason I'd still rate it higher than the Kindle Fire (KF) now that I have one as well.  The problem I have with the KF is it's pretty out of the box, but once you start using it, it's not as flexible as a more "vanilla" Android tablet.  The KF has it's own special set up that I personally don't care for.  And it's a bit of work (that I'd rather not go through) to skin it down to the natural Android OS.The KF has an awesome screen.  I'm not gonna lie, there's a huge difference when the 2 sit side by side.  And this makes a big difference when reading e-books over long periods of time.  The technology used on the KF's screen is different and I'm sure that's where the added cost partially comes from.  However, when playing videos, the P7 wins out.  At least as far as I can tell, as one of the main problems I have with the KF is that many of my videos I've downloaded/created cannot play on the KF...at least without conversion which is sometimes a painful process.  And even then I don't have the 1080p HD quality of the original.  Touch-wise, they're about equal.  The responsiveness and fluidity are very similar.The other thing the KF has going for it is a dual core processor.  Websites load quicker and switch between apps is smoother.  But that's not enough for me to justify an extra $50.  I can be patient enough for 5-10 seconds longer waiting for a website to load.Beyond those 2 things, the P7 has the KF beat as far as I'm concerned.  Both have 8GB of internal memory but the P7 has a MicroSDHC slot so I've got 32GB more to play with.  Additionally the USB port on the P7 allows for flash drives.  So it's very easy to get content on my P7.  For my KF I need to either stream or download from my cloud drive if I need anything outside of the internal 8GB worth of goodies I store there.Speaking of content, one of the top reasons I want to own a tablet is to take videos with me.  As I mentioned earlier, the KF doesn't take most raw video formats as is.  Conversion is typically necessary and it can be a painful process of trial and error depending on the original file.  On the other hand, I've yet to need to convert anything on my P7...everything I've thrown at it has played without problems.The second big reason I wanted a tablet is for an e-reader.  The KF was, of course, built specifically for that reason, but as the P7 can use the Kindle app, as well as Comixology, Mangazoo, and other readers, there's not a big plus as far as the KF is concerned.  As I said before, the screen was made for long hours of reading and is great for reading indoors or out.  That's where it has the upperhand against the P7.Neither tablet has Google Play, which boggles me when I see reviewers complain about the P7 not having it and therefore are returning it then ending by saying they'll get a KF instead.  Both handle the Amazon Appstore fine and I also use 1Mobile for my P7 as well.  I've yet to try other appstores on my KF as Amazon's Appstore just works so naturally and easily on the KF.I could get into more detail and comparissons between the two but overall I love both tablets.  However the Prestige 7 just has that edge, making me glad I bought it.  It's much more versatile and being $50 cheaper (at least when I bought it), worth the difference.	
763	4	3	4	3	4	3	1	4	3	3	4	4	Works great for me! I love this little jewel! I have owned it for two weeks now and have learned to make it do lots of tricks.  I am a "techie-grandma" and wanted the newest Android system (Ice Cream Sandwich).  Look at the spec's!  It has everything I wanted and it all works well.	
764	4	0	4	0	4	3	0	4	4	4	0	0	Unacceptable Customer Service. I really don't have the time to spend hours tracking down retailers who should stand by their products irrespective of price. The only reason I am doing this is that my 10 year old spent her own birthday money on this and I hate to see her disappointed and taken advantage of. On arrival, the tablet would work only when plugged in. It would not take nor hold a charge. DOAs happen with any electronics, but I expect the manufacturer or distributor to repair/replace the defective unit. We spent two weeks trying to contact Visual Land via phone calls, emails, and their website forms. All went unanswered. Tiger Direct, the shipper, has likewise not responded. I guess they know this thing is a lemon. Now I am trying to escalate with Amazon. This whole experience has been Completely Unacceptable and I would not trust this mfr or distributor again.	
765	4	4	0	4	3	4	1	4	4	4	3	2	good to great. Love it buy it has a few problems with easy fixes. Problems: the pre-installed kindle didn't work but uninstalling and reloading it again from the Amazon site was a good  fix. Sometimes the browser freezes. I have a 1 mb connection. It shouldn't freeze. No Android market therefore no Google play. That was a short-sighted marketing move.  I was able to go to Google play and download from there. Otherwise it is a good device and works well.
