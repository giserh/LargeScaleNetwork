Content: Unstable. I just finished packaging my Transformer Prime for return.Pros: Fast performance, nice screen and overall build quality, WiFi reception was fine.Cons: After loading the ICS software update, the tablet began to randomly lock-up and restart. First lockup was about an hour after the update, but then the tempo increased to every 10 minutes or less. I tried uninstalling flash and using dolphin instead of the default browser but it didn't help. The lock-ups happened in various apps. After looking at xda developer forums I'm not the only one with this issue, so I decided to return the prime while I still can rather than hope that it was a software problem that Asus could correct.

Content: Asus customer service  - SLOW - finally back - hope it keeps working. I finally got the tablet back and it appears to be working as it should. It was a gift for my wife and she seems pleased. Time will tell how it works out. Still disapointed that it was a dud when it first arrived and I am still disappointed that I had to wait for the "repairs". Asus should have shipped me a new unit when problems started.  =====I ordered the tablet back in December - 2011  knowing it would not arrive until January - 2012. The tablet arrived - I read the very simplistic information provided. Charged the unit overnight and then tried to confugure it. The unit would not connect to my wireless network. I checked the wireless net and it was working fine with my laptop and phones. The tablet had problems and without a wireless connection you are out of luck. I sent back the unit to Asus - I should of sent the unit back to Amazon for a refund - lesson learned. I still don't have the tablet back from Asus as of 2-10-2012 and it was sent back in January. Asus told me they had to order a part for the unit.  Bottom line if the unit fails just send it back to Amazon and don't mess around with Asus and if you have to use the Asus customer service - good luck.

Content: Fastest Android Tablet I have used yet. I am not going to lie - first off, the GPS does not work on my unit.  It will not pick up any satellites either indoor or outdoor.  Wifi and Bluetooth both work fine.  I am not interested in using the device as a GPS device, but I probably should get it replaced since I have no GPS signal at all.As far as the actual product goes, it is definitely the fastest Android tablet that I have ever used.  Setup, as with any tablet, is very simple - no problems at all.  Once I was logged in with my Google accounts, I ran the product update and easily upgraded to ICS, Android 4.0.  I love ICS.  I have it on both this tablet and my Xoom Wifi, and it works without a hitch and is the best Android Tablet experience yet.I did later purchase the keyboard dock and it is a top notch product.  It is the one item that makes the Prime a totally unique tablet experience.  Remove the tablet for media consumption (surfing, streaming, some emailing), then attach it to the dock for serious text/data entry.Pros:  Size, weight, speed, ICS 4.0, ability to make into a mini laptop, ability to use Bluetooth mouse.Cons: Faulty GPS, Missing the myriad of awesome apps (especially games) that I have in iOS

Content: Very good, HOWEVER... The Asus Transformer Prime is a very good tablet, it has all of the functionality of a regular tablet, plus some (if you get the dock). It's lightning fast and plays 3d games like they're angry birds on the original iPhone.However, there if one (yes only one) downfall. (Well, maybe two, I'll get to that later. The Wifi connection on the device is a little sketchy. I currently have two "smart" devices (not including my laptop), my Asus Transformer Prime, and my Motorola Triumph.I have a Netgear Router that has an "N" connection, also compatible with "a" "g" and "b". Ok, solid. So the Prime can connect to N connections, therefore it should have lightning fast speeds... no? Well, despite the fact that there is a router probably a solid 30 feet away from me in my office while I'm in my living room, I generally only have one, maybe two bars. Ouch. Data speeds are not as lightning fast as they should be. If I decide to walk into my office though, I'll just about instantaneously get a solid 4 bars. I have yet to try out anything on Speedtest or any equivalents for that matter, but I can tell you from personal experience that there is a noticeable difference.Now, let's get back to my Motorola Triumph, the small thing only has a 1 Ghz Processor (an old one at that) and can only connect to "a" "b" and "g" networks. Despite that, it gets a solid 4 bars in the exact same place in my living room. And despite the fact that it only has a single core processor that clocks in at 1ghz (well really 1.3 now that I've rooted it, and no I have NOT rooted my Prime... there could potentially be a yet there) it has comparable speeds to my Transformer Prime at times. When we compare that to my Transformer Prime with a quad 1.6Ghz Tegra "beast" you can sort of see how come it can get a little frustrating. Now, let's be honest here, the Prime is usually loading full size sites in comparison to the bite sized mobile sites my Triumph usually loads, and it most definitely has faster speeds with all of the "important" things like Facebook, so I'll be honest here and say that speeds are if anything slightly faster, but the thing is they should be miles faster. In the words of Samsung, they should be another GALAXY faster... no?The other thing that doesn't work so perfect is the GPS, not always the best, and while I hate to bring up my Triumph again, although I can NOT tell you the exact details of how much better the GPS is, it's certainly better on the Triumph than the Prime...Let's wrap this up before I go write a book. So to finish, even after all that, I would most definitely still recommend the Transformer Prime, the specs are great, the display is beautiful, and the battery life is just incredible (no official tests, but maybe like 10-12 hrs off a charge). On top of that, it's thinner and lighter than an Ipad 2 (thereby making it thinner and lighter than an Ipad 3 as well) and has by far the most responsive touchscreen I've ever used. While most people are probably going to shy away from this product, because the 300 series is coming out for a slightly more affordable price, and Asus is eventually going to be releasing a 7 inch tablet with the same processor specs as this for $250 (rumor), I'd still highly recommend it. As this review mostly seems to focus on the negative, I'd suggest that you check out all of the amazing things that are on the Asus website, because just about every last one of them are true, as long as you can keep in mind that you just might have spotty wifi and bad GPS (although I don't really see the point of GPS on a tablet).

Content: iPad Killer My Butt... I'll be short and sweet as there are MANY very informative reviews here. I bought my Asus back in January when it was touted as the best of the best and the only iPad killing tablet out there. Well not only has the camera NOT been working since I bought the tablet, but the extremely slow wifi speeds absolutely frustrate me. Unless I am within 10-12 feet of my router (this includes sitting in the basement right near it, or sitting in my living room which is located directly above where the router is located in the basement) the signal is little to nothing. I need to be right next to the router in order to have all the signal bars full...at 10 feet away I already drop one bar.  In 95% of my house I'm lucky if I get one signal bar which means extremely slow connection. My daughter's first generation iPad blows my Asus away when doing anything wifi related. The performance of the rest of the tablet is very good but because the wifi is so absolutely terrible I can't EVER recommend this tablet. What a waste of my time and money.As for the camera.. it has never worked. I have never called tech support so perhaps it could be fixed, but I don't need a camera on my tablet so it's no big deal for me. I do wonder whenever I get a software update if it will fix the problem, but they haven't yet. Maybe one of these days I'll call them up and see if there's something we can do to get it fixed.

Content: Getting there. The first impression I got after stating my Prime for the first time was "WOoow". The problem is that feeling started to fade away and turned into total disappointment.Although the CPU is supposed to be powerful you normally get stuck in between apps and stuff like that. That is really minor considering that the Android is meant to run in different hardwares. Another point is the GPS which does not work without the dongle they have released later on. Ok ok it is a tablet, you really don't need a GPS when you have it on your smartphone.Three months after use, I have noticed two white spots on the bottom left/center of the screen. After couple of minutes researching in google, I had learnt that this is a problem A LOT of people are having with their primes. Whenever the screen is dark, you can not tell. But if you use your tablet for websurfing, kindle etc, you always have these annoying white spots in front of you. I decided not to send the table for RMA, given the terrible reviews of the ASUS support!Another two months on, I tried to dock the tablet to the keyboard and... NOTHING! Would be able to charge, but not type!!! After rebooting, redocking, etc etc. decided to take a look at the connector. basically one of the pins was a bit up. It probably got damaged after docking the keyboard. I look after my gadgets and I am sure I did nothing wrong with the tablet! After some more googling I found more people suffering from the same problem. This time I was really close to sending to RMA, but still wary....Last week after disconnecting the tablet from the power supply, I discovered that the connector was completely damaged!!! Although the connector really looked fragile and damaged, it was still charging.but I thought it was just a matter of days until the whole thing would get damaged! Finally I sent it to RMA!!!Anyway!!! After waiting for a couple of days, the tablet arrived at the support center and according to them it is a customer induced damage!!!! At the moment i don't know how much they will rip me off to get it fixed and whether it is going to be effective or not!In summary it is a nice gadget. But I don;t remember having an electronic device in 32 years of my existence that gave me so much trouble!!! All I know that was my first and last Asus!!! Gave the wife an Ipad! Although I don't like the apple products, I have to say that she is far happier than I am with my ASUS. I regret not buying the Samsung Galaxy Table instead! I have the phone and have been working flawlessly for two years!!!--------UPDATE---------I have just received my prime back from service. I must have looked younger than my little daughter..... I have to say that they seem to have done a great job with the Tablet. Ok ok they have charged me 28 euros for the connector, but the screen (white spots issue) was fixed within the warranty. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the customer service. Although the online status of the repair was a dreadful experience, the ASUS representative that contact me initially with the status of the RMA was very helpful by email and I had a prompt response. After receiving the tablet fixed and working properly (like new) I would give 4 stars for the customer service. Considering my initial 2 stars for the table I will raise my review to 3 stars, hoping that my tablet will last long enough.

Content: Not a good tablet. I am not going to go into great detail on the issues that I have experienced since most of them are specified in other reviews.Here is a list of problems for this tablet that is now 6 month old: Very poor wireless reception, a failed micro HDMI connection, a failed 3.5 mm headphone outlet,I have sent it back to the service center but so far have gotten nothing but a run around from the Asus call center that is located somewhere in India. Asus customer website is down and I am unable to trace the progress of repairs. ( every time I enter an RMA number that was generated by Asus, the website states : "no such repair number exists, please contact the service center"). When attempting to use a webpage link to obtain a telephone number for the US repair center, a scroll down menu remains blank.Overall, a very frustrating experience. I would very strongly urge anyone considering purchasing an Asus TF201 to look elsewhere.

Also be aware that Asus has announced at CES 2012 a 3g model where the GPS is fixed and it has HD screen (1920x1080) vs (1200x800) of the current model for a $100 extra.

Content: Update on tablet. I've had this tablet now for 6 months, and while many people have had problems with the GPS and WiFi, I haven't run into any issues - if you're getting this tablet for gps use, be forewarned that it requires the ASUS dongle for it to work correctly, which means not being able to use the tablet in the keyboard dock while using GPS.  For me, the tablet has been well worth it, but there have been many people who have run into 'bad' production tablets, so be careful when considering this tablet.

Content: Problems with GPS. Transformer Prime is right now the best tablet out there but there are still problems that should give anyone pause when considering buying it - apparently the GPS issue is hardware related (the alluminium backplate is causing it) and the WiFi signal seems to be worse than on all other WiFi devices. Still, Asus promised unlocking the devices bootloader which makes it quite interesting Android tablet. Especially with ICS coming very soon.

Content: Loved it until this: Serial Number "Unknown" bug. I loved my Prime. I didn't have any issue with wifi, and the GPS worked fairly well. I hadn't received any notification for the OTA .29 and .33 updates that came out last week, but didn't think much of it and updated manually off the ASUS website. Last night when the long anticipated Android 4.03 ICS update came out, I didn't get that one either. I went onto XDA this morning, only to find out that there were several threads including one that was 10 pages long, about a nasty bug in which some Primes were shipped without a serial number embedded into the software. Apparently it's a fairly large percentage considering all the people now stuck with no OTA updates. The bottom line is, if you go into: system info > about tablet > and see Serial Number "Unknown", you'll never get an OTA update. Not only that, you can't root (if you care), and can't boot into stock recovery either. I'd post the link to XDA, but Amazon will remove it, so either Google it, or head over to the XDA Forums. There's also info on it on several other forums too. I returned mine when I called ASUS, and they told me they didn't expect to put the 4.03 Android online for download, and denied any knowledge of this major issue.

Content: Well worth the LONG wait! A little backgorund on my search for a tablet.I had been thinking about getting a tablet for a couple of years.  Initially I simply wanted a way to read my school text books without carrying them around.  At first I was going to get a kindle.  However, the IPad was starting to come out, so I decided that why not get a "reader" that also can help with researching on the web?  I am an anti-apple guy and just could not bring myself to purchase an IPAD, especially since it didn't even come with a camera at the time.  So, I decided on upgrading my phone to the Motorola Droid X.  I loved the Android software and the screen was big enough to read books.Fast forward to about 5 months ago.  I seriously started researching the various Android tablets, which had flooded the market since I had first begun thinking about a tablet.  I am an information hound and love looking stuff up on the fly and my laptop was always in the way at home.  Therefore, I was now on the market for an Android tablet.  The Xoom and Galaxy were priced too high for me, the Toshiba Thrive was appealing, but the Sony 32 GB was what really caught my eye.  Then, after feverishly researching in late November, I started to see Asus pop up.  I had never heard of Asus, so I was skeptical.  Wasn't sure it was something like those generic brands such as Coby, or Pan Digital.  I was determined to buy a quality tablet, one which I would not come back later and wish I had spent the extra money afterall.  The Transformer Prime was listed at $500 for 32 gb, with the fastest processor, better cameras, latest Android software, and was not bulky like the Thrive.I was so excited that I put in an order both on Amazon and Best Buy with Amazon coming through first to my pleasure (I am a loyal Amazonian).  First impression:1)  What a beautiful screen!  The colors were crisp, clear.... breathtaking!  I never imagined such a thin piece of technology could look so good.2)  Super fast.  I am not sure what issues people are referring to with regards to the Wifi.  I click on the browser and wham! My homepage pops up and I am able to surf quicker than my pc, or laptop.3)  Really thin!  To be honest, I am not sure if this is really a good thing.  I bought my Wife the brand new Acer A200 and the thickness and almost rubber back makes for a better grip.  I cannot wait till the case I ordered comes in because I am nervous about dropping it.4)  A little confusing to navigate through the menus.  It might be the Android $.) (which I upgraded immediately), or the Asus built in software.  I am used to my Droid X, so it may just be lie when I first used Windows Vista.  Hated it at first, but after getting used to it, I can't imagine going back to the prevoius Windows versions.Pros:-The responsivness and clear video makes for great game play, picture viewing, watching videos, etc.  I am not sure what most people are expecting from a tablet, but this is the most important to me.-The price is extremely pleasing, especially since Samsung is selling their 8.9" unit for $450!-The camera placements are perfect and the quality of pictures are better than most cameras I have owned.  I will enjoy taking videos of my kids to upload without having to wait for my phone's camera to respond.Cons:-File management.  I may just need to spend more time playing with it, but it is a little confusing.  Also, the Asus "My Net" software used for connecting to other units either doesn't work properly, or is just lacking in capabilities.  I should be able to connect and access the files on my other systems connected to my Wifi at the house.  So far, I have not been able to figure out how to do this.  I want to be able to transfer music and pictures from one system to another like I do now between my laptop and pc.-No print option.  I am researching now how to print via my Prime, but all I find are folks who tell me to use a print app, all of which are not as easy to use as I had hoped.I will follow up later after gaining more experience with my Prime.  However, I am extremely pleased that I did not have to purchase an Ipad to get the speed, responsiveness and screen clarity all in a very light and thin (almost too thin) tablet.  Don't let any Apple snob tell you otherwise.  Android is the way to go and it is about time a quality product came on the market at this price range!

Content: Amazing Tablet despite other reviews. I have been using my tablet for about a week now. ICS is great and haven't run into and major issues. The biggest things that everyone is talking about is WIFI and GPS issues. I have had neither with this tablet. Upstairs where my router is located I recieve full signal. Downbstairs in the farthest end of my house I get 3 bars occasionaly dropping to 2. More in part to the age and signal strength of my router. I have already ordered a new stronger router and should have no issues. I have run two seperate GPS apps and both lock on and are with in 15ft of my house. Couldn't ask for much more. Some of the other apps like Google Maps are less accurate but close. The bad reviews for the GPS are ludacris and should be dismissed. Even if the GPS didn't work it wouldn't hurt my feelings as for a whole it is used very little in day to day stuff. My only issue is android, which isn't really Asus's fault. Just wish the market was better organized and formatted for tablets. Frustrating downloading apps that are stratched to fit the screen. But all in all the I love the tablet. The design is great and the metal back plate looks sharp.

Content: Be real. Be real. If you only want to play games and you are an adult why waste your hard earned money. The original asus transformer is great. After all a tablet is a tool for purposes of productivity and surfing the net for useful information or even watching movies. I don't see why so many people are waiting for the prime. Truth is I have the prime but honestly it is no better than the original transformer. Who cares whether it is quad core or whatever. Don't fall victim to clever marketing about how well the games will look. It's your ability not the processor that will improve your performance.  I am returning mine since I received it as a gift. No issues with the gps or wi-fi on my original. I know lot of you are going to disagree with me. But if you want bad wi-fi, terrible gps and lest I forget an easy to scratch case, be my guest. Those of you who own both know exactly what I am talking about. Just hope this alleviates some of you from the frustration of waiting and waiting for something you think will be better.

Content: Amazing Hardware Ruined by Terrible Software. I gave this tablet three weeks and two software updates, but after taking a trip with it this past week taking it instead of my laptop I've had enough. There are just too many issues with this device and all of them are due to Asus' terrible software. Here are my main complaints:- Laggy interface: ICS optimized apps do OK on this tablet, but everything else is sluggish and rough, considering the horsepower on tap that is just inexcusable. Even MX Video Player, an ICS optimized app and the only hardware accelerated video player for Android, cannot play HD video correctly with the hardware video decoder. What exactly is that 12 core GPU in there for again?- Internal storage read/write performance: Anything you do that accesses the internal storage causes the entire system to slow down and stutter, so installing or updating an app, unzipping a file, moving files from folder to folder causes the tablet to become practically unusable while it's doing any of these things.- USB transfers: Transferring files to this thing from your computer is nearly impossible, I wanted to put the pictures from my phone on the tablet, about 4 GBs total, I could pull these files off my phone in about 30 seconds, but the same files would have taken about a day to upload to the tablet. USB transfer speeds are crippled, again due to to poor I/O performance of the internal storage. I've had to use AirDroid to transfer files, which still takes a couple of hours to move those 4 GBs.There is also the hardware issues with WiFi and GPS, the GPS is a non-issue for me since I always have my phone with me, but the WiFi performance for me has just been OK but not great.With the recent tablet announcements in the last few weeks I'm going back to the sidelines, I'll even consider the Transformer Infinity if it seems they learned from their mistakes, but mark my words: The Prime is nothing more than a prototype, released for no other reason than to make a statement about Asus' hardware designs and to be the first quad core Tegra device. This is proved by the fact the before the Prime was even readily available at retail there was a better Transformer already developed and ready with a better screen and a better antennae design.

Content: Great aside from WiFi issues. So, like many others, I had WiFi issues with this device.  I sent the device back to Asus and based on the parts list they added a "Conductive Sponge", "MB Top Absorber", and "Flange PCB & GPS Foil".  After the repairs, the WiFi still didn't stay connected for more than a minute or two at a time.  I ended up replacing our old Linksys WRT160N v3 with an Asus RT-N56U and now the Transformer Prime stays connected without issues.  Now that the WiFi issues are fixed, I don't have any complaints about the tablet.  The interface is extremely responsive and games are smooth.The only complaints I have are in regards to Asus support. First, they aren't very responsive.  The online ticket system states that they will respond within 48 hours of submitting a ticket.  It took them 2 weeks to get back to me, and then they just said to put in an RMA request as this may be a hardware issue.  I put in the RMA request, and that was approved in about a week. After shipping the tablet to Asus, I received no confirmation that it was ever received or an ETA for when it would be finished. Even so, the device was fixed in about a week and a half, and I received notification that the tablet was being shipped back to me. Now that it's fixed I'd say it's worth 5 stars, but I got the device back in late January and it's just now working properly, so I'm giving it 4 starts instead.

Content: Nonfunctional GPS. The tablet works great for the most part, but the GPS will never connect. I received the GPS dongle and it doesn't do anything, I still can't use it to navigate. Asus makes great stuff, but the customer service is horrible. The only response I've received to my emails is, "The prime was never intended to be a professional GPS device and we've removed that functionality from the spec sheet." Doesn't fix the fact that it was listed when I bought it. Unlike the European division the US version is not eligible for refund apparently.

Content: Great except for minor issues. So far it has been working great. Speed seems excellent, no issues with wireless and runs smoothly. Minor issue has been inability to charge the device with charger provided. It only charged once and then stopped working. I have been charging it via USB in sleep mode or combo on apple adapter and ASUS USB wire in sleep mode. Other issue was not able to read music from default folder. I created a new folder and it worked fine. Screen is too shiny/glossy and with any light around its not easy to focus. They should have provided anti-glare or at least recommended one.

Content: Cracked screen. When I first bought this it was the best I could find. I really did my research! The game play was amazeing, the sound decent... I Absolutly loved it. Perfect laptop replacement. Then came a night when I was significantly let down. I was watching utube videos and there was nothing wrong. Absolutly nothing. When it was time to put my children to bed I set my tablet down on the kitchen counter in its docking station where it sits every time it is not in use, and there it stayed for about 30 minutes. Once my duties were done I went to check my emails before going to bed when I noticed a crack in the screen. Not a small scratch, not an unnoticeable crack, but a a hairline crack from the top left corner to the bottom right. I had done nothing wrong to damage the tablet. I have investigated this issue and there are numerous complaints on numerous web sites, including androids own web site. After three weeks of waiting for them to locatate the tablet that had arrived three days after I sent it in I was told that I would need to pay an extra $200 to fix the issue. So if you have the extra money to dish out everytime the screen decides to break for absolutY no reason this is the tablet for you! Other than that it works great.

Content: Great tablet for the price. I have had my tablet for 2 weeks and have been pleasantly surprised with how good is really is.  I have tried the Ipad2, Toshiba Thrive, Acer, Hp Tochpad.  The android tablets all had problems with the 3.0 os and the hp became a 99 toy...not bad.  The ipad2 was returned due not being able to use flash...but it basically was the best of the bunch.  This little android is pretty close to the ipad 2 and actually better due to price.  If you can live with the idea of not having the latest os, its a keeper.  The battery life has been nothing but amazing.  Yesterday, I had this with me on a day trip and had on from 6am to midnite when I got home and battery life was at 62%.  That was after having my grandson using the tablet for angry birds non stop for 3 hrs, connected to wifi all day while my wife shopped, and then watching a movie on the drive back home.  Not sure why some people complained about the power button, I have found it pretty easy to turn on and off.  I am still using my tablet today without charging yet, and battery life is still at 55%.  The apps are super smooth.  You tube videos seem to run fine, I've had a couple lag a little but nothing I can't live with.  I haven't tried to tether to my iphone yet but the bluetooth worked fine in my auto to play my music.  I also downloaded a printer app to be able to send online docs to the printer. The more I use it, the more I forget why I wanted the new os system anyway.  When u connect to the pc, file transfers are a breeze.Also, I have found a few bluetooth apps that to do wireless file transfers but have not had a chance to try them out.  I did use the skype video calling with no problem...no rear camera, but are u really gonna use this for picture taking?

Content: For email and basic browsing maybe... First I must say the build quality is impressive as others have noted. It seems many reviewers are first time tablet users, so I also feel it's important to mention that I am tech savvy, and I have used a wide variety of tablets and smartphones.The Le Pan had intriguing specs and good reviews and is at a price point that android tablets will be most competitive against the ipad elite. But, I'll boil this down...1) It is good for what you pay - great screen, nice looking body, easily handles gmail and simple web browsing... Does well with angry birds and the like... But nothing more video-intensive2) LAG - video playback is a struggle, simply moving around in android has noticeable delay at times - just sliding around using multitouch has a distinct lag compared to my touchpad and direct comparisons of youtube and flash playback were very blocky and disappointing3) Support - several reviewers stated positive comments about le pan support... Le Pan was completely unresponsive to all 5 of my emails with simple questions when I was deciding whether or not to buy and no one was available to answer the phone the 6-7 different times I called over a 3 week period. I am not at all impressed.4) I returned the TC 970, it's just not up to par. The Le Pan II has impressive specs and could potentially perform nearly as well as my touchpad, but the total unresponsiveness of the company would keep me from buying.  Even though the HP touchpad is defunct, you can still always reach a support person.

However Too bad that this device continued to freeze and a hard reset was required to get it working again, only to have it freeze again in less than two minutes of running time. It had everything you could want in a tablet for a very good price, the only two faults I found was the freezing and that you can't upgrade the Android 2.2 OS to the newest 4.0 Android OS. I had to return the Le Pan and will order a Toshiba Thrive or a Acer Iconic, both have very good reviews. Amazon was very quick with the return process and refund.

Content: Le Pan 970. Le Pan 970 Tablet is really great. I don't see what IPAD could do that Le Pan can't. The display has the same resolution and the sound is quite reasonable. The few apps I've tried work fine. If you like Androids Le Pan is definitely a very good deal. Of course the 2 Gb disk is a bit on the low side but it can be easily and cheaply upgraded.The real question is what is a tablet like that (or an IPAD) good for? I am still trying to find an answer, but it is definitely not a PC.

Content: Impressive Toy. My Le Pan tablet is really nice and it is fast, and has a great screen view.  It is a solid piece of business.  Other than the smudge-magnet screen, I have no complaints.  My review title is based more in the view of tablets in general, and perhaps Android in particular.  You see, the thing does not seem to do anything I am interested in doing, or conversely, it does only those things I am not interested in doing. While it easily set up a Gmail account, which I did not really want, it is unable to set up a Yahoo Mail account, which I desperately did want.  While I wanted to increase my productivity, without email this thing is really just a hunk of plastic and aluminum. I have also failed (about 20 times) to get an Amazon Apps account set up.  Interestingly, neither Yahoo nor Amazon have been any help at all.I have already paid for and downloaded a number of productivity apps (through the Google Market that comes in the Le Pan), but they are moot without the email.  If you like Android and tablets, this unit is excellent.  I, however, am going to stop hauling this thing back and forth to work; it is simply a time waster.06.01.2012:Most of the issues I mention above have been corrected; I have Yahoo Mail.  Unfortunately, I have grown to dread using this tablet.  I type a lot, but the virtual keypad here is so sensitive that I hate using it.  Also, the unit seems to have weak WiFi reception.  So I leave my rating the same.

Content: Wonderful, but.... Everything good that has been written about this tablet is true, but ....the firmware implementation of WIFI communications is not robust. With the nice new routers at my house and several friends houses it performs great. The router at work with a T1 and strong signal but older protocol- passable. But several tested Starbucks and McDonalds-- no go after the first time-----Kept trying to get an IP address; fail, and then cycle thru trying over and over. My other two devices and everyone else in the joints had zero problem. Went back home and it was great. Problem-- I need a tablet I can travel with and depend on to get email, directions, reservations, etc. The first order of business for mobile device is connectability to the existing cyberworld and everything needs to follow from that. I love this tablet but it has to go back. No help from manufacturer but expected none. Thank goodness for Amazon. Seriously bummed; there are some very nice things in the implementation of this tablet.

Content: Major problem with touchscreen after activating from standby... Upon activating the tablet after it's been in standby mode for a while, the touchscreen becomes essentially non-functional for several minutes.  For example, after activating from standby and reaching the unlock screen with a pattern, I tried numerous times trying to swipe the correct pattern.  However, for some reason, the touchscreen would never "maintain" the line I tried drawing while swiping over the circles.  The line would always "breakup" before I could finish the pattern for 4 circles.  It seemed to be skipping from one circle to the next without any continuous connection.  This happened for about 5 minutes, until it finally read my finger swipe correctly and unlocked.  Frustrated, I decided to try a password lock instead of a pattern.  So I put the tablet on standby for a while, reactivated it, and tried putting in my password via the keyboard.  However, whenever I pressed a key, it would read it as double, sometimes even triple (e.g. pressing the 'd' key once, would result in 'dd' or 'ddd' being entered into the password field).  This happened with all the other keys I pressed, and continued for several minutes, until it stopped doing it all of a sudden and was finally able to put in my password.  Frustrated again, I turned off any lock.However, not being able to control the unlock screen with finger swipes wasn't the only issue after returning from standby.  Whenever I tried to use pdfs after returning from a long standby, I could not control scrolling or zooming.  Anytime I tried scrolling, it would zoom in and out.  This would continue for several minutes until it would finally function normally.So it's pretty clear that with my tablet, something happens to the touchscreen functionality after it's been in standby for a while.  I always had to wait several minutes after activating from standby for the touchscreen to work properly.  The touchscreen keyboard must be "reloading" during that time, or something.  But yea, this is unacceptable for me.  I tried doing a factory reset as well as downloading the new firmware, but it still kept giving me the same problem.  I really wanted to enjoy this tablet since everything else works decently, but this one major flaw with the touchscreen has led me to return this tablet.I've been anti-Apple for the longest time, but after trying out the ipad 3 and its retina display, I think I may take the plunge and get it.  I had narrowed my tablet choices to only 4:3 format because my main uses are reading pdfs, textbooks, and magazines, and it looks like the ipad is the only other option out there.  Also, that retina display makes pdfs look amazing, especially small font on documents.  I had considered the Coby Kyros Android 4.0 with the 9.7 inch screen, but the negative reviews turned me off to it.It's possible that it was just my Le Pan 2 touchscreen that was defective, so hopefully you future purchasers of this tablet don't run into the same problem.

Content: Don't Believe The Hype. Le Pan II 9.7 inch tablet pc with 8 GB flash, available to upgrade to Android 4.0.4 I purchased the le pan II after reading the reviews on Amazon as well as researching it on line. I am currently an owner of an Ipad which I truly enjoy. I was looking for something less exspensive for my husbands birthday.  The majority of the reviews were very positive, I was a little hesitant, but also excited because of all of the features described.  Out of the box it looked and felt great, but soon after that, I realized it "ain't no Ipad".  It would have a full battery, and 100% wifi signal, but would say no signal.  It would be fully charged, but would not come on. I had to reset it weekly.  I would use my Ipad at the same time as my husband attempted to use the le pan, but he wouldn't be able to get a signal, or it just wouldn't turn on at all. We use the pads to surf the internet and read email mostly. The le pan performes poorly at these simple task.  I was very disappointed, and upset with myself for wasting my money. I should have saved it and purchased the Ipad.  I could not in good conscious recommend this product to anyone.

I had high hopes for this tablet.Though it is fast and works well i have no troubles using it at all.I have owned over 10 tables over the last 3 years, so i have much to compare against.I liked everything about it, but the golden test for me is how well videos play.I was very disappointed that in playing videos the screen brightness is just not there. It causes videos to be far to dark for me.People with dark clothing causes it to look totally black. I will be returning this tab.

Content: Don't buy it, unless you want to have constant connection problems. The damn internet connection never works on this sucker! 've had my connection checked multiple times and it works fine on every computer in my house, cept this tablet. I returned my last one for a new one, which they replaced free of charged, but shipping it to them cost me $30. So that cancels out. My new one works fine for a little while, before it starts having problems with internet connection as well. I don't recommend buying this at all! If a tablet has no connection, its pretty much a useless screen. Mine sits on a shelf somewhere in my house gathering dust.

Content: le pan ll 4.0.4 i.c.s. - buggy at first, performed factory reset and now working fine. About me: windows "power user" with 13+ years pc and 6+ years computer programming experience. Most of my friends come to me with their PC problems. I have used other tablets before, first-time using android.About the let pan ll: at first, the tablet gave errors when trying to download apps from Google play store, was unable to install adobe flash player, and was generally very buggy. After "googling" for answers and not finding any, i finally gave up and performed a factory reset. After the reset, everything worked fine and I have not had any problems at all since then. I noticed that some apparent 3rd-party apps were missing after the reset. I assume these were installed at the factory and were the causes of the problems.After sorting-out the issues, I am very happy with the tablet. The build quality feels solid, and battery life is very good. The battery will last for about 7-8 hours of constant use with mixed web surfing, game play, etc. If not used for gaming, a single charge will last for 2+ days. I would recommend this tablet to anyone looking for an affordable android tablet.

Content: If only there was a zero star... I understand refurbished to be in working order, yet when I received the tablet it clearly had a note saying "charger defected". I plugged it in and it was correctly labeled as it did not charge. So, I pondered the age old question to return or keep. I kept and bought a new charger lest I have to deal with a refund and non-recoupable shipping charges . When all was said and done I should of bought new. I do however wonder why, knowing the charger was defected they sent it out? I guess in the listing they do say charger...just not working condition. Though isn't that what refurbished means?

Content: Somewhat disappointed. Seemed to be a good choice, good reviews at a good price. Unfortunately, I kept having trouble with the touch screen which was very erratic. Sometimes it worked great, others hit or miss. And sometimes it wouldn't work at all. Tried to get used to it, but it was just too much aaggrevation to put up with.  It could have been just that particular unit, but I didn't have the stomach to try another one. Switching to another brand.

Content: internet crashes; on-off switch doesn't work very well. I did not buy from Amazon, but I did purchase -- and return -- this tablet.  There were issues with the browser crashing fairly frequently; but even worse, when I turned it off completely (rather than just hibernating or entering airplane mode) I had to plug in the charger in order to get it switched back on.  It didn't need charging, but somehow needed that power for the switch to work.

Content: apple iPad. I recently bought my husband an iPad for his birthday. The iPad is great but the support from apple is about the worst I have ever encountered, they are hard to get to and once you do you have to go through automation for about 5 to 10 minutes and then you can speak to a person. I am very upset with this support system, I guess Amazon has spoiled me because I can talk to a person right away. So if you buy an iPad make sure you know all the ins and outs of the item before you buy it.

Content: Why I chose the iPad over other tablets. Since there are many reviews out there with specs and user review, I will take a different approach by telling you why I chose the iPad over other tablets (even with the latest Asus Transformer Infinity).Yes, the iPad doesn't support Flash, it has a less powerful processor than some tablets (at least the Asus Transformer Infinity), it may be heavier, etc. But here are my three major determining factors to settle with the iPad:- App experience- OS performance- Full synchronization with the iPhone** App Experience **If you are gamer on your mobile device, you won't grow tired of the unending list of games on the iOS platform. According to a PC Magazine article, as of March 2012, the iOS has more than twice the number of games on Android from the "top 10 mobile game publishers as judged by Mark Fidelman of Technorati". Tom's Hardware also interviewed four mobile game developers and it seems the iOS is still the best platform for game (and other apps) developers which means many great games will still only be available on the iOS platform. I will post links in the comment section.Even if apps are available on the Android platform, the experience on the iOS is still superior. I have played the same games and used the same apps but they are not the same. I did some research and I found out it's because there are "fragmentation issues" in the development process on the Android platform.** OS Experience **The Android OS is more flexible than the iOS when it comes to customization or widgets. I have an Android phone and I enjoy the ability to use the power control widget to quickly turn on/off 3G, Wi-Fi, Hotspot, Bluetooth, GPS, etc. But to me, the iPhone and iPad simply trump other platforms in terms of smooth handling and responsiveness. I constantly experience some type of lag with Android phones and tablets. Even with the Asus Transformer Infinity, I see lag in video playback in some of the YouTube review. With the iOS, these lags are significantly less. So I am not saying the iOS is perfect but it is certainly the best in class.The CEO of Microsoft recently said that their new tablet called Surface will compete against the iPad in a way that will "leave no stone unturned" in their battle with Apple. Google also has been focusing their attention on mobile products. Competition is great for us consumers but it seems like Apple still have a significant edge as the first mover.** Full synchronization with the iPhone **My wife has an iPhone 4 and and iPad 2. I spent some time with the two devices for a couple weeks and I was fascinated with the synchronization between them. When you download an app on one device that's compatible with both the iPhone and iPad, it appears automatically on the other device. Notes, photos, videos can also be sync. I haven't tried this with a combination of Android phone and tablet but my assumption is that it won't be as effortless. With the iOS, I feel like I have two of the same device but in different size and form factor.** Conclusion **This is my take after using both the iOS and Android systems and I prefer the iOS even if some of the devices out there may outperform the iPhone or iPad. The general consensus is that the new Asus Transformer Infinity does outperform the iPad in terms of processing and battery performance. It's in wide screen, it has an expansion slot, and it has HDMI out. But it's the iOS ecosystem that swayed me toward it. Yes, Asus or HTC can come up with a more powerful device but they can't create another app/developer ecosystem as with Apple. The Android is the second best to me, at least for now.

Content: Stunning display. Fast LTE. Good battery life. I upgraded after owning an iPad 2 16GB Wifi + 3G. The screen alone was worth it. Being able to fit 4x as much information on the screen is fantastic. Text remains sharp even when very small. SpeedTest on LTE from AT&T; topped out at 27 Mbps down and 14 Mbps up. Wish the data plans weren't so stingy, because at this rate you can blow through your month's allotment of 2GB in 10 minutes of downloading... but that's really AT&T;'s fault, not Apple's.Usability is second to none. I'm a pure Windows guy and even I concede defeat here. The iPad is intuitive and easy to use. It's also very responsive. Snappy when it switches back and forth between apps. Pinch/zoom and flipping motions are fluid. Android tablets are getting better all the time, but the iPad is still king here.Battery life is pretty good. With light use, I charge it probably every 2-3 days.With more apps being updated to take advantage of the high resolution display, I find more and more of my storage space being stealthily consumed. With 75 apps, 100 songs, 3 videos, and about 150 pictures, my 16GB iPad has about 5GB of free storage. If you're someone who feels the need to carry more of your music or video collection with you, you'll probably want the 32GB version.The iPad is locked down, so you're limited to the Apple-approved apps you can install through the App Store. This has always been a curse and a blessing. The experience is refined, but power users can feel confined. You can always jailbreak it, though at the expense of your warranty.The worst part about the iPad is having to use iTunes. It's got an outdated feel. It poorly manages media folders. It's a memory hog. It's got limited support for music formats. It stealthily tries to install Safari and QuickTime at every update. Wouldn't put up with it if I wasn't stuck with it.

I mean you get no instructions with this thing except a web based users guide that I stumbled across.  I can watch Netflix on it now.  Needs a pretty good Wi-Fi signal though or else it looses contact with the web.  Would I pay this much again.  I doubt it.

Content: Needed to install update since unit was 2 years old. FYI to potential buyer:  I  needed to install iOs 6 update in order to install certain apps. The Apple store which did it for me with their software searched the registration and found that this iPad was two years old from the time of manufacture. (Hence, I'm sure, the discounted price.) Nothing wrong with the unit, it is brand new, just that it had the old iOS.5. I believe seller should disclose provenance and date of manufacture.

Content: Excellent! I would first like to say I DID NOT purchase this item on amazon because the markup is silly high. I have read allot of the amazon reviews and feel that some reviewers are very unfair on the product. So with that said please read my review if you are considering buying.I bought the 32GB wifi and Verizon 4G in whiteI currently own the retina display iPad in whiteIn the past I have owned the galaxy tab 10.1, the Samsung ativ pc pro, galaxy note, and kindle 8.9 HDI love the iPad mini. I think it is very practical for everyday use. It is easy to hold, battery life is excellent, typing is easy, equipped with a few movies, a few games, and the kindle AP you always have entertainment wherever you go in a small and beautiful form factor.Many people are raising a fuss about the non-retina display... This does not bother me even though my primary device before the mini has been the retina iPad. You can see pixels, it's not so beautifully crisp as the retina but it is still above adequate for reading, gaming, etc. after an hour or so of using this device I don't even notice the difference. I owned the kindle fire, and while the screen was HD and looked great I couldn't stand how tied to Amazon I was with it (sorry amazon I love you)  and well... I had other issues with it as well.Some people are claiming the device is slow especially when buffering utube. I have not seen any difference in speed from my iPad 3. As far as gaming goes words with friends is the only game I play and it works flawlessly on the mini. Perhaps if your buying the iPad for gaming you would be happier with the iPad 4 ( or whatever they are calling it) because it has more RAM and a faster processor.The form factor of theMini is simply amazing, I honestly can't complain about the lack of retina because I think that's too much to ask right now for any manufacturer to get into such a slim and light package. You honestly can't truly understand how amazing this thing is until you have used an iPad 3 for a significant amount of time, the weight and bulk gets to you. The iPad mini fits so well into my purse and I can hold it easily for hours with one hand. I can read and rock my child to sleep at the same time now!You should only get the wifi version unless you have a share everything plan as my husband and I do, then you can ad your tablet on for a low fee to your existing plan. I would never pay 30 dollars a month for a separate plan. I love that you can use FaceTime over the 3G or 4G, I tuck this into my purse and if my son is doing something particularly cute on the playground during daddies lunch break we can call him and say "hi".As far as cases go, I am a minimalist so I love the Smart Cover paired with a clear plastic back so I don't cover up the beauty of my mini. The Smart Cover is different from my iPad 3 smart over, the hinge does to have any metal showing and it snaps on tighter and looks much nicer. I tried the Griffin thin case folio (I think that was what it's called) it was really nice looking but when the mini was in it it didn't lie flat hindering some of my key presses on the outer edge of the device. I recently read a review on this product and the man raved about it, so maybe I just got a faulty case.Apple care+ feels like a must on this device. Because I will be carrying this wherever I go and because its so slim I want to cover my a** if I drop this beautiful piece of equipment. If I bought the 16GB wifi only version I might not pay the extra dough for AppleCare +.The speakers really surprised me on this little device, they are loud and clear! I still wish Apple would include headphones in every package as well as an adapter for the new power connector (we all know Apple is stingy) but they don't.I am really excited about this device, I could have saved money and purchased a google nexus 7 or any one of the other 7 inch devices but their battery life, build quality, and battery life are inferior to the mini. (Yes I am sure someone will send a nasty comment when they read this about me being an isheep) I don't stand behind a product simply because it is made by a certain company, I stand behind a product when it is a damn good product. I recognize the mini has some shortcomings but they far outweigh the greatness of this beautiful product.

Content: Love My Apple Ipad Purchased From Amazon./com. I am thrilled with my Amazon purchase of an Apple IPAD MD366LL/A and the numerous capabilities it offers.  It operates very similar to the Apple Iphone so I had little difficulty in setting it up and getting started using it.  I am elated that I can surf the internet and the larger screen/monitor allows me to read the results with little difficulty.  It was a definite plus to learn that I could download a free APP which allows me to import and read my previously purchased Kindle Books as well as use it to purchase and read  IBooks.  The Ipad with its larger keyboard is very handy for text messaging. When I want entertainment I can play games.  The Ipad is much easier to tote around than a laptop computer, yet, it performs many of the same functions.  To sum it up, I just don't know why I didn't buy one before now.

Content: Great product but Capacity is not 16GB. I purchased this new model for my wife here through AMAZON.  Delivery was quick and unit was delivered new.  So far she enjoys it a lot. She enjoys her streaming videos everywhere around the house.  Picture quality is great.  Response is better than her old laptop.  I would give this product 5 starts but find one big issue with it.I purchased a model that is sold as 16GB and yet it says capacity is only 13GB when we view it on I-tunes.  1GB less might be Ok but missing 3GB is a bit too much.  I will be calling Apple to see if there is some defect with this unit.  My old I-Pod was listed as 8GB and showed 8GB of total storage. The price for these units jumps a lot for every few GB's so feel a bit cheated with the loss of 3GBs.Second reason for only three stars is that these units don't charge with the USB connection to our normal desktop computers.  You have to use the AC adapter to charge it.  This might be due to the current required to charge these larger batteries so make sure you have an extra AC Adapter if you travel.

Content: The New ipad, to be or not to be? My review is divided in to 2 parts. The pre purchase and the post purchase review.The prepurchase review:The release of the new iPad has left many of us in a state of indecisiveness. People who own, and those who have never owned an iPad are facing the same dilemma, to be or not to be. Most of us had high hopes that the new iPad would put an end to our life-long quest for an ideal tablet. Unfortunately, it did not. It now seems that the new iPad is more of an option rather than an upgrade to its predecessor. The market for iPad 2 therefore has not closed. In fact, even before the release of their 3rd generation tablet, apple had already announced that they will continue to manufacture iPad 2 and sell it at a reduced price.The purpose of this article is to help you decide whether you should buy the new iPad or stick with its predecessor. So, let us take a look at different scenarios where one version may be preferred over the other and vice versa. But first let's summarize all the important issues that have made the new iPad center of criticism.In the order of preference:1. overheating: it is now a common knowledge that the new iPad is running 13 degrees hotter than its predecessor. There can be two important implications of this issue. First, many people have pointed that they feel uncomfortable when holding the warm tablet for prolonged lengths of time. This feeling might become worse in the hot weather, especially when there is no AC to cool you and your iPad down. Imagine holding a sick child who has a fever of 102 degrees, but this baby is running a temperature of 116 degrees. Second, many have raise concerns over the effects of the high temperature on iPad's delicate hardware.2. Wifi connectivity: there are enough whiners on apple forum complaining about the new iPad's noticeably inferior wifi reception. For some this problem is more annoying than the heating issue.3. Battery: it takes twice the time to charge the new iPad to full than iPad 2. It has also been seen that the new iPad is falsely displaying a 100% charge figure when in fact it is continuing to load its battery for at least another hour after the percentage is displayed. Another, even bigger disappointment is the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy duty' app, such as games, videos or multitasking.4. Voracious appetite for data: being an HD model, understandably it needs more fuel to run than the previous models. I wish there was some kind of 'standard mode' that people could switch to inorder to conserve data, unfortunately, there isn't.5. Higher demand for memory: since most of its apps must be HD, and therefore 'heavy', the need for both static as well as Random Access Memory is naturally higher. Unfortunately, this entire HD concept has transcribed in to rendering the cheapest member of its family, the 16GB, more or less dysfunctional, at least for the aggressive tablet users. So if you want to buy anything 'functional' you must pick 32 GB or higher version.7. Few more ounces: This is not really a major issue but people who are used to holding the previous versions argue that the additional ounces further decrease the number of hours they could support the tablet on their palm. I personally believe that the heating factor would have kicked in way before you felt the strain from those few extra ounces.8. Same old dorky front camera: even though the rare camera has been upgraded the most functional camera of the iPad, the front camera, has been ignored. I completely fail to understand the logic behind this idea.9. Lack of Siri: most people were expecting to receive this iPhone 4S feature in their new iPad. But all they got was disappointment. Some people think that apple might have intentionally saved Siri for their next launch. However, apple has added a brand new feature to the new ipad, the dictation, and it may offset the disappointment to some extent. It is noteworthy to mention that both Siri and dictation need Internet connectivity to function.With this basic information about the new iPad it will now be easier for me to recommend the edition of the iPad that will suit your needs.So who should buy the new iPad?The biggest and perhaps the only visible plus of the new iPad thus far seems to be its display. All other features are more or less subdued by its lack of basic luxuries. For instance, the higher RAM feature is neutralized by the higher demand for memory, so on and so forth.So, if you are a digital photographer, the new iPad is the tablet of choice for you. No other display will give you even the closest visualization of the pixels that you captured.if you are a low to medium level surfer and like to read books and magazines with colorful graphics and display, the 3rd generation is the way to go.Game lovers who have extremely sensitive senses for sensing the speed, the new iPad is your gadget.If you are a big fan of shooting pictures and videos with your tablet (which is kind of odd, though), the new iPad is your tool. But you have to give me a genuinely convincing reason for choosing a tablet over a digital camera or even an iPhone to shoot quality photos and videos.Beyond this I would seriously recommend to meticulously outweigh risks verses benefits of buying the 3rd over 2nd generation iPad.And, who should buy the iPad 2? Well, everybody else who does not meet the above criterion. If you are an aggressive tablet user and must hold it for an infinite number of hours without having to bear the discomfort due to its higher temperature or weight or strain to your `retina', you are an born to use iPad 2.For intense ipad users a sluggish charge time is definitely going to be a deal breaker when purchasing the new iPad. Additionally, the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy' apps will add to its disability.For Navigation lovers, iPad 2 will certainly have an edge because of its quick charge time while you are on the go.People who live in wifi unfriendly homes should think twice before buying the new iPad.iPad 2 is light on your pocket if you are a big time GSM user. Since there are no unlimited data plans for iPad so one must use the data prudently to avoid being billed multiple times in a month. Both Verizon and AT&T; offer no more than 5 GB of data per charge for iPad. Here again the classification of aggressive vs low to medium user should help you decide between iPad 2 and the new iPad.If you are low on budget you could save a some money by choosing iPad 2. This is not only because of the recent price slash of iPad 2 but also due to the fact that the new iPad's higher memory requirement has only left you with the choice of purchasing its pricier version that has more memory.if you are a big time video chatter buying the new iPad will not make your experience any better than ipad 2 since no change has been made to the front camera of the tablet. Second, if you are chatting on a GSM plan you will now be burning more Mb/minute that you would with the previous version.Conclusion: Consider the New iPad if you are a big time digital photographer (professional or hobbyist) and if you are a low to medium tablet user. For everybody else, there is iPad 2.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The post-purchase review:I did eventually end up buying the new ipad. I took a chance and bought the least expensive third generation. I placed an order on the apple website and the item was shipped straight from China. The neat thing about this deal was the free personalized text engraving. I wrote 'Made for ...our names' and added my address to it as well.So, what is the deal with the New iPad? Well, to be honest, the heating issue was barely discernable but I really did not hag it to the limits so I am probably not the best person to pass the final verdict on the heating issue. But the real issue here was the display. Yes, 'issue'. I was quite disappointed to see how the pictures on various Internet sites appeared on the new ipad. Most of the facebook avatars appear fuzzy and ugly. People say that this effect is similar to the one we noticed when HD cameras first became available. They would magnify even the slightest wrinkle on your face and make you look darn ugly. But I am not the expert here, all I can say is I prefer my ipad 2 over the new ipad for facebook and picture surfing. Another important mention that I would like to make is about YouTube videos. Contrary to what one (me included) would have expected the new ipad is no better than ipad 2 in displaying even the highest resolution videos on YouTube. Infact the colors appear slightly distorted as compared to more natural looking ones on ipad 2. The new ipad does however have a slight edge over the ipad 2 when it comes to displaying high resolution pictures downloaded straight from high pixil DSLR camera.The next thing that I would definitely like to mention about the new ipad is its dictation feature. I must say that this is a great achievement. The transcription is more accurate than most other dictation apps. The best part is that this feature is integrated in to the keyboard so you do not have to open a seperate app to use it. You can use it almost anywhere where the keyboard pops up. But the question really is how many people will actually use this feature to make it a must-have option, I would say, not too many.I did not come across any issue with wifi connectivity. And, the thickness and heaviness was completely beyond my perception levels. With your eyes closed you can barely tell whether you are holding an ipad 2 or the new ipad. It even fit into the tragus leather case that is made for ipad 2 without ANY problems.And now I am sure most of you would like to ask me whether my opinion about the new ipad changed after I purchased it. My answer would be NO. I still think that all the 'yummy' features that the new ipad has been stuffed with are 'optional' and do not justify the release of a brand new version. People could have comfortably lived with the iPad 2 for another 2-3 years.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Content: Needs an SD Slot Desperately. The iPad 3 is pretty much the iPad 2 with a better screen and nothing more. That statement is of course not entirely technologically factual. But at the end of the day, it is feels more true than the fact that there are differences in specifications between the two devices.Ram, processor -The iPad 2 in some instances felt constrained with only 512mb of ram, so the iPad 3 was supposed to feel like an improvement when it comes to app management and multitasking. However, that difference is negligible. The iPad 3 packs 1GB of ram which is the minimum amount required for an acceptable experience. But due to the fact that the iPad 3 is driving 4 times as much pixels in the screen as the iPad 2, the experience is pretty much the same. Both devices render websites at the same speed, some games are faster on the iPad 2, some games have greater detail (yeah, believe it) on the ipad 2 than the 3, etc. The design of the iPad 3 chip shows a great increase in power even though it is still is clocked at 1Ghz due do a doubling of graphic cores from 2 to 4. But testing reveals that the increase in power is entirely used to drive that high definition screen and is not felt elsewhere.Screen, application size and Internet usage -The improvements in the screen are magnificent for people who care about reading on the iPad. But then again a lot of users do not notice a difference between the screens, and i was one of them. Staring at both iPad 2 and 3 side by side does not reveal the WOW factor to me that everyone has been talking about. What is obvious is that apps that are used on iPad 3 are much larger than the same apps for iPad 2 since these apps must have high definition imagery. So if an app is 20mb for iPad 2, the same app may be 80-100mb for iPad 3. If an app is 100mb for iPad 2, that app may be 400mb for iPad 3. If you're using a limited plan to download these apps, you may be running out of bandwidth sooner than you anticipated, and if you only bought an iPad 3 16GB like I did, it may only take a day to run out of storage space. 16gb was definitely not enough. The iPad line now needs an SD slot more than ever.- Processor - improvement is negligible and not felt over iPad 2- Ram - improvement is negligible and not felt during multitasking- Storage - it's the same storage for the same price, but more limited due to an increase in app size to support the high definition screen. You run out of storage faster than before. Charging the same price for limited storage is also a big NO. Apple should have already made 32GB the norm and included an SD slot.- Screen - improvement is obvious especially in reading and text rendering, but to some it's a drawback since it increases app size- NO Sd card slot to increase storage is truly disappointing. This is my main problem with the iPad line, and with the 3rd iPad it got even worse.-  Great 9 to 10 hour battery life- iPad 3 is thicker and heavier than iPad 2 - again a drawback- iPad 3 also has a warmer corner than iPad 2, not that big a deal, but an annoying featureFor me all of these factors caused me to return the iPad 3 within a week, but since I needed a tablet for textbook use, web reading, and my partner was already annoyed at me using his iPad 2 all the time, I walked into a GameStop and picked up a used 64gb iPad 2 plus 3G for $499 and 2 free iTunes gift cards totaling $100. The same price as an iPad 3 16gb. That was a much better deal in my mind than the iPad 3.The iPad 3 is not worth the hype, and since it under-delivers in almost every category but for the screen and 4G, I do not recommend its purchase. If you own an iPad 2, wait for the 4th to come out. If you're purchasing a new tablet, I'd consider the iPad 2 for $399 16gb or a used one with larger capacity for a cheaper price. Or the nexus 16gb for $249. Just remember iPad 2 has no Siri, dictation or other advances present in the iPad 3 due to apple's choice to only include the latest features with the latest iPad.  My jailbroken iPad 2 does Siri and dictation as well as an iPhone 4S and iPad 3. All in all I'm happy with my decision. 64GB of storage is fantastic.If iPad 4 comes with an SD slot, I'll definitely be looking to upgrade in the next year, if not my iPad 2 will be standing with me for the foreseeable future.Make the decision that best works for you.Good luck!

Content: Crapple's latest "innovation" My mother got one of these for her teaching job. Being an Android fan, I looked at it. I was not impressed because:(1) Its almost the same exact thing as the iPad 2. (Ooh Retina display! Great.)(2) It runs iOs, not Android. Enough said.(3) Not much different from other tablets. (And the iPad was NOT the first tablet.)Though their are some pros:(1) Makes a GREAT paperweight! I can not tell you how many papers this thing could hold down!(2) Efficient weapon. The screen breaks so easily that if you are under attack, grab the nearest iPad (check the trash cans, you will find one within your first few tries) break the screen, and defend yourself with the glass!

Content: Warning! Beware of scams! I was so excited to get an iPad 3 with retina display. Unpacking was nice (original packed and sealed). Then I turned it on and I loved it. I would have been happy without any concerns. Luckily, my husband knows what a retina display looks like and this was not one... He checked the product number on the box and according to google it is an ipad 3 with retina. Then he looked up the product number in the ipad settings and figured that this is an iPad 2 and NOT an iPad 3! Apparently I got an iPad 2 in the box of an iPad 3. I think this is unbelievable! I expect frauds like these from craigslist, but not from Amazon!

Content: Excellent! I would first like to say I DID NOT purchase this item on amazon because the markup is silly high. I have read allot of the amazon reviews and feel that some reviewers are very unfair on the product. So with that said please read my review if you are considering buying.I bought the 32GB wifi and Verizon 4G in whiteI currently own the retina display iPad in whiteIn the past I have owned the galaxy tab 10.1, the Samsung ativ pc pro, galaxy note, and kindle 8.9 HDI love the iPad mini. I think it is very practical for everyday use. It is easy to hold, battery life is excellent, typing is easy, equipped with a few movies, a few games, and the kindle AP you always have entertainment wherever you go in a small and beautiful form factor.Many people are raising a fuss about the non-retina display... This does not bother me even though my primary device before the mini has been the retina iPad. You can see pixels, it's not so beautifully crisp as the retina but it is still above adequate for reading, gaming, etc. after an hour or so of using this device I don't even notice the difference. I owned the kindle fire, and while the screen was HD and looked great I couldn't stand how tied to Amazon I was with it (sorry amazon I love you)  and well... I had other issues with it as well.Some people are claiming the device is slow especially when buffering utube. I have not seen any difference in speed from my iPad 3. As far as gaming goes words with friends is the only game I play and it works flawlessly on the mini. Perhaps if your buying the iPad for gaming you would be happier with the iPad 4 ( or whatever they are calling it) because it has more RAM and a faster processor.The form factor of theMini is simply amazing, I honestly can't complain about the lack of retina because I think that's too much to ask right now for any manufacturer to get into such a slim and light package. You honestly can't truly understand how amazing this thing is until you have used an iPad 3 for a significant amount of time, the weight and bulk gets to you. The iPad mini fits so well into my purse and I can hold it easily for hours with one hand. I can read and rock my child to sleep at the same time now!You should only get the wifi version unless you have a share everything plan as my husband and I do, then you can ad your tablet on for a low fee to your existing plan. I would never pay 30 dollars a month for a separate plan. I love that you can use FaceTime over the 3G or 4G, I tuck this into my purse and if my son is doing something particularly cute on the playground during daddies lunch break we can call him and say "hi".As far as cases go, I am a minimalist so I love the Smart Cover paired with a clear plastic back so I don't cover up the beauty of my mini. The Smart Cover is different from my iPad 3 smart over, the hinge does to have any metal showing and it snaps on tighter and looks much nicer. I tried the Griffin thin case folio (I think that was what it's called) it was really nice looking but when the mini was in it it didn't lie flat hindering some of my key presses on the outer edge of the device. I recently read a review on this product and the man raved about it, so maybe I just got a faulty case.Apple care+ feels like a must on this device. Because I will be carrying this wherever I go and because its so slim I want to cover my a** if I drop this beautiful piece of equipment. If I bought the 16GB wifi only version I might not pay the extra dough for AppleCare +.The speakers really surprised me on this little device, they are loud and clear! I still wish Apple would include headphones in every package as well as an adapter for the new power connector (we all know Apple is stingy) but they don't.I am really excited about this device, I could have saved money and purchased a google nexus 7 or any one of the other 7 inch devices but their battery life, build quality, and battery life are inferior to the mini. (Yes I am sure someone will send a nasty comment when they read this about me being an isheep) I don't stand behind a product simply because it is made by a certain company, I stand behind a product when it is a damn good product. I recognize the mini has some shortcomings but they far outweigh the greatness of this beautiful product.

Content: My first iPad. I kept myself away from 1st and the 2nd gen iPad for past 3 years. I thought having a windows tablet would make lot of sense to me. But after 3 years still there are no windows tablet and windows 8 is planed to be released by end of 2012. And there will be host of tablet makers good/bad/ugly onces in the market and trying to find the best one is difficult. So that means another 1.5 years of wait.Meanwhile, about 8 months back I purchased asus transformer 1st gen. It kept me happy for sometime, but latter I was less than happy with its performance. With the death of asus transformer tablet that I own, it was no brainer to buy the 3rd gen iPad.The iPad does what it is advertised to do, it is a giant iPod touch, but the larger screen is always better.The tablet is all nice and good, the apps, the performance the acceleration, the retina display etc.BUT the display calibration is bad. I have iPhone 4 and now iPad 3. iPhone 4 has much better color reproduction quality than iPad. The white on iPad looks pale white instead of pleasant white on iPhone.If the display is not able to reproduce the white properly then there is no way (IMO) it will be able to reproduce other colors properly.I have attached an image showing the difference between iPhone 4 and iPad3 display.EDIT1: I am doing a battery cycle test, i.e. charge to the maximum, discharge till it shuts off. Then recharge back to 100%. It took about 6-7 hrs to discharge the battery completely mostly reading books and surfing and few 1-2 min youtube video.And it is taken me 6 hrs to charge from 20% to 85%, I did not track when I put it charge at 0% so it has actually taken much longer to come to 85%. It is not a good deal with the batter, right? The battery discharges way faster than recharging. I am using the adapter and cable provided by the iPad 3. The battery recharging capability is less than satisfactory to me.Edit2: I upped my rating by one star because I am more than happy with the performance of the device.  How fast I can type compared to the android device I had and many apps that are polished for good experience.

Content: It's just a shame! Connection and Photo Syncing Annoyances. I actually bought the Ipad 3, 64GB wi-fi version from Apple maybe a month or so ago.  Long story short is that I absolutely love the Ipad for everything it can do, BUT, there were two reasons why I ultimately returned it:1. Connections:  I still really find it annoying that the only connection you have to this Ipad is the normal connection as seen on every single previous version of the Ipad.  Look, I know there is that adapter that you can buy separately that connects a USB cord to the Ipad as well as the SD card as well:[...]But, the general public that has bought the item specifically for the Ipad 3 are consistently complaining that it is very shotty and doesn't really work.2. THE BIG ONE!!!:  Itunes and the TERRIBLE interface when trying to sync photos from your computer (either PC or Mac ... and for me specifically a PC with Windows 7, 64bit), to the Ipad 3.  Not, Ipad 2, I'm taking about the Ipad 3.  Why is nobody complaining about this HUGE problem on this site?  If you don't believe me, just type in "Ipad 3 Photo Syncing Problem" on Google, and be amazed.  If you want to save the time, click on the below link which will take you directly to the blog as discussed on Apple's own community website.[...]Just start from that page and read on through 23 other pages, of complaints with this issue.  Some people offered solutions, some worked, but the bottom line is is that Apple continues to deny this problem, and there has been no recent fix/update with Itunes to remedy it.  Even though Itunes update 10.6.1 says:About iTunes 10.6.1iTunes 10.6.1 provides a number of improvements, including:* Fixes several issues that may cause iTunes to unexpectedly quit while playing videos, changing artwork size in Grid view, and syncing photos to devices.So, all in all, once Apple fixes this issue, I will not get the Ipad 3 again.  People reading this, please post your comments if you are experiencing the same annoyance that I experienced.  It is truly a shame as the majority of people that buy this product want to use it to show off their amazing high rez photos on the beautiful Retina Display that the Ipad 3 has.Thoughts?

Content: Sad. Even the iPad is a great device, the apple app store dosn't describe well the applications. For example, I have paid 20 dollars looking for microsoft office app; when I'm going to use it, the 20 dollars' app is really a tutorial to supposedly become an office expert. It was really frustanting. Plus, in order to transer files from my desktop to my iPad, I was charged for another 20 dollars thanks to iTunes download (on my desktop), price that never was ask to my beacuse it said it was free.To sum up, iPad is a great device, but the app store is frustating.

Content: Still the best tablet 3 years later. My iPad 2 started to have memory issues when running more than one app or many browser tabs at the same time. I was hoping to use my iPad 2 for 2 years and get the iPad 4. I decided to try the newest android tablet the Samsung note 10.1. I experienced many issues on it and in the end I missed the usability, reliability and apps of my iPad 2. I decided to get the iPad 3 and am very happy with it so far. It is more expensive and has less features than the Samsung note 10.  But it is still the best tablet on the market hands down. The iPad is really easy to use, has a huge app market for tablets, good support, good build quality, lots of accessories, retina display and air play.  When I first read about the iPad 3's retina display I thought it was a gimmick. After owning and using it I do see the difference with the screen. Since I spend a huge amount of time on my iPad 3 (mostly reading) it makes sense to get a better screen. They say it's suppose to be better on your eyes even if you have bad eye sleight. I also see the difference when watching videos or viewing pictures. In terms of speed I don't really notice the difference from my iPad 2. The extra ram is probably the main thing I've benefited from by getting the iPad 3. I do wish apple would improve the speakers on the iPad by making them stereo and not down facing. That's once thing I miss from the Samsung note 10. The samsung note 10 also had the ability to do real multitasking not the seudo stuff apple does. The note 10 could also run apps simultaneously side by side. These are things apple could do to improve their tablet even more. Although the iPad 3 is only slightly heavier and thicker than the iPad 2, I still notice the difference. I know that apple had to put a larger battery to power the higher resolution screen, LTE and processor.  I just think its unlike apple to release a product that is heavier, thicker and offers less battery life than it's predecessor. I haven't updated to iOS 6 yet as I heard it slows down the device, gets rid of YouTube/google maps and wifi issues. I am waiting for an update and also a jailbreak for ios 6. I am looking forward to Siri for the iPad 3, browser enhancements, email enhancements and Facebook integration. In the end apple won me over with air play since I own 2 apple tv 2's. No other tablet or mobile device anything like air play or as easy to use as AirPlay.Early November 2012 update: Well Apple screwed us iPad 3 owners by releasing a new iPad just 6 months after this one. The iPad 4 has a faster A6X chip, dual channel bonding wifi, a hd front camera and lightning connector. The new chip is suppose to make the iPad 4 twice as fast as the iPad 3. The dual channel bonding will make wifi connectivity twice as fast when connected to a n network support router. The lightning connector is suppose to charge the ipad 4 about 45 minutes quicker than the previous version. Personally I wanted an iPad that was thinner, lighter, had more ram and stereo speakers. Do yourself a favor dont buy the Ipad 4. Wait for the iPAd 5 which will most probably be thinner, lighter, stereo speakers and more ram and look like the ipad mini. In my case I was within 3 weeks. The apple store let me return mine for a full refund. I came home and placed an order for a iPad 3 refurb. I got my refurb wifi 64gb for only $550. Which is a great deal. I really dont know why Apple couldnt have waited a few more months for a newer version. Who knows maybe Apple will release a new iPAd in march or april again. The only reason to get an ipad 4 is if you do alot of gaming, photo editing or video editing otherwise your not really going to notice the difference or be worth your while. Save your money and get the ipad 3 refurb or just wait until the ipad 5.

Great as a book end or door stop, but not very useful as a tablet.The tablet suddenly turn on two weeks after we got it. I bought it for my daughter and she ended up giving birth a little early and didn't end up being able to deal with it.  It turned on just as she was about to box it up and send it back.

Content: The new iPad is Hot! Literally! Still a Great Product! This  is a review of the Apple iPad 3 or the "New" iPad as Apple likes to call it. The main question is, should I buy this? The answer will vary from person to person, but I can help you decide to see if it's worth it. First of all, let's take a look at what is new in this version of the iPad. Please note this review will be long so only read the parts that interest you. If you are truely curious, feel free to read the entire thing.Top Things in the NEW iPad: The A5X chip with quad-core graphics drives four times the pixels of iPad 2. The A5X chip is the main thing in the New iPad. It is what delivers the New Stunning Retina Display! With a 2048-by-1536 resolution you can't argue that the New iPad obviously has a way better screen than any other iDevice. With an amazing 10 hours of battery, the new display is really going to get noticed. Due to the fact it now has the A5X chip, the iPad is a lot faster and has really amazing graphics! The new 5MP Eye Sight camera is also something that is really enjoyed on the new iPad. Even though most people aren't really used to taking pictures with a 9.7 inch display tablet this update might encourage people to do so.Now, Let's get into detail. I will break up the review in segments in order to make it more convinient for you all.==== The A5X Chip ====You might be asking, " Is the new chip really such a difference?" The answer to this question is, yes. The new A5X chip, although not seen, is what makes the new iPad so great. It is the source behind the improved graphics, faster responces, and even the really improved Retina Display! Trust me, the new iPad is something truely amazing!==== 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight Camera ====The new rear camera on the iPad is now a 5 Mega Pixel Eye Sight camera! What is Eye sight ? Let me put it this way. It is similar to professional DSLR Cameras with Autofocus. That's right, the new iPad has similar features to professional DSLR's. With really good Macro Focus and all-around high quaity pictures. Although 5 Mega Pixels is not that high, the pictures still look really nice on the iPad's Retina Display. MegaPixels matter, but there are other things like Aperature and shutter speed that have a dramatic effect on pictures. This is what is new on the iPad's camera. There is stilll room for improvement in the cameara. They could add a Flash which would make the camera truely spectacular. For now though, the camera is definitely a great improvement from the iPad 2.==== The Battery Life ====Now the battery life on the new iPad can vary from user to user. If you are those types of people that enjoy having the Best Display at all times the battery life is going to be reduced drastically. You can get more life by changing the screen brightness. The iPad has a nice feature to it called Auto-Brightness. This enables the iPad to automatically turn the brightness of the screen higher when you are outdoors and when you are indoors it automatially lowers the brightness to the point where it is just right. On auto-brightness the battery can still last a good 10 continuous hours. This means using it 10 hours non stop. Of course most people don't do this. They leave it on standby. If you only use it a couple of times per day the life can range to maybe 2 full days. Since the battery is larger and it lasts longer it takes more time to charge than an iPod or an iPhone.==== The Display ====As I mentioned before, the display is amazing on the new iPad; however, it is something so great that I can't cover in a review. The best way to decide is seeing it for yourself. I would recommend seeing one in person for you can truely observe the new display with your own eyes.With all of this said, What can an iPad Really do? I will answer this in the sections below...An iPad is basically a computer in some words. It can really be a computer with the right accessories. Some required things to take full advantage of an iPad are:* A wireless printer that supports Apple's Air Print.* An Apple TV to stream with Air Play.* A Bluetooth wireless keyboard that is supported with the iPad* A good case to protect your iPad.Let's take a look at what an iPad can truely do...==== Air Play ====If you have an Apple TV you can stream wirelessly to your HDTV. For Example, If you want to share some pictures with your family, now you can with Air Play. You can wirelessly send infromation to Your HDTV in which you will be able to see pretty much everything you see on your iPad. From Youtube videos to Photos to even Netflix.==== Air Print ====If you have a wireless printer that supports Air Print you can now print straight from your iDevice. For example, you have a PDF file that you just edited or a really great Picture that you just took. With Air Print you can print this from basically anywhere in the world. Even if you are in another county you can send an e-mail to your printer and your printer will wirelessly & Automatically start printing out whatever you sent it! This is someething truely amazing!==== Games & Apps ====With an iPad you have a wide variety of applications and games that you can install on it. With Apple's App sotre there are literally hundreds of apps to choose from with most ranging from FREE to around $5. There are two types of applications on iPads. There are normal apps that were meant for use with an iPod Touch or an iPhone and then there are HD Apps. The High Definition apps were meant for iPad only and they look a lot better than iPhone Apps; however, both are fully functional. The Games will look a lot better on the new iPad as it now has the A5X chip.==== Dictation ====Dictation is a new feature on the iPad. It allows you to speak text. An example would be writing a note in the notes section of the iPad. Instead of typing it out slowly, you can now just say it and the iPad will turn it into text! Save time by literally talking to your iPad. This is also very helpful when sending e-mails.==== Siri ? ====Apple has released to us that in its new update that is coming soon it will allow the new iPad to be used with Siri! The main feature that made the iPhone 4S such a big hit is now going to be integrated into the iPad. Just another great reason to buy an iPad 3.==== iOS ====iOS is the magic behind the  iPad. It lets you see and do everything using Multi-Touch. Apple likes to boast about it being the worlds most advanced mobile oberating system. With every update making it even better, this is a true reason to buy an Apple Device.==== iCloud ====iCloud is new in ios 5 allowing your iPad to update its self with the "cloud" wirelessly of course! You no longer need to own a computer to own an iPad because of this amazing new feature! It also allows you to store all of your apps, music, and movies in the cloud! With this said, it automatically pushes all of your pictures, apps, etc to all of your other iDevices wirelessly! It also allows you to restore an iPad and get all of your contacts and information automatically if you ever have to restore an iPad.Overall:This is a truely outstanding product that is just amazing. The only reason why this is not a 5 Star product is because it tends to be hot! Literally it gets really hot if you use it for around 2 hours. This and the fact that it can still be improved in some areas. Overall though it is a great product that I would not hesitate to buy. I recommend this product for everyone who is looking for a Tablet. I hope that this review helped you guys out. If it did please feel free to say that it helped you out in the buttons below. Thanks.

Content: Needs an SD Slot Desperately. The iPad 3 is pretty much the iPad 2 with a better screen and nothing more. That statement is of course not entirely technologically factual. But at the end of the day, it is feels more true than the fact that there are differences in specifications between the two devices.Ram, processor -The iPad 2 in some instances felt constrained with only 512mb of ram, so the iPad 3 was supposed to feel like an improvement when it comes to app management and multitasking. However, that difference is negligible. The iPad 3 packs 1GB of ram which is the minimum amount required for an acceptable experience. But due to the fact that the iPad 3 is driving 4 times as much pixels in the screen as the iPad 2, the experience is pretty much the same. Both devices render websites at the same speed, some games are faster on the iPad 2, some games have greater detail (yeah, believe it) on the ipad 2 than the 3, etc. The design of the iPad 3 chip shows a great increase in power even though it is still is clocked at 1Ghz due do a doubling of graphic cores from 2 to 4. But testing reveals that the increase in power is entirely used to drive that high definition screen and is not felt elsewhere.Screen, application size and Internet usage -The improvements in the screen are magnificent for people who care about reading on the iPad. But then again a lot of users do not notice a difference between the screens, and i was one of them. Staring at both iPad 2 and 3 side by side does not reveal the WOW factor to me that everyone has been talking about. What is obvious is that apps that are used on iPad 3 are much larger than the same apps for iPad 2 since these apps must have high definition imagery. So if an app is 20mb for iPad 2, the same app may be 80-100mb for iPad 3. If an app is 100mb for iPad 2, that app may be 400mb for iPad 3. If you're using a limited plan to download these apps, you may be running out of bandwidth sooner than you anticipated, and if you only bought an iPad 3 16GB like I did, it may only take a day to run out of storage space. 16gb was definitely not enough. The iPad line now needs an SD slot more than ever.- Processor - improvement is negligible and not felt over iPad 2- Ram - improvement is negligible and not felt during multitasking- Storage - it's the same storage for the same price, but more limited due to an increase in app size to support the high definition screen. You run out of storage faster than before. Charging the same price for limited storage is also a big NO. Apple should have already made 32GB the norm and included an SD slot.- Screen - improvement is obvious especially in reading and text rendering, but to some it's a drawback since it increases app size- NO Sd card slot to increase storage is truly disappointing. This is my main problem with the iPad line, and with the 3rd iPad it got even worse.-  Great 9 to 10 hour battery life- iPad 3 is thicker and heavier than iPad 2 - again a drawback- iPad 3 also has a warmer corner than iPad 2, not that big a deal, but an annoying featureFor me all of these factors caused me to return the iPad 3 within a week, but since I needed a tablet for textbook use, web reading, and my partner was already annoyed at me using his iPad 2 all the time, I walked into a GameStop and picked up a used 64gb iPad 2 plus 3G for $499 and 2 free iTunes gift cards totaling $100. The same price as an iPad 3 16gb. That was a much better deal in my mind than the iPad 3.The iPad 3 is not worth the hype, and since it under-delivers in almost every category but for the screen and 4G, I do not recommend its purchase. If you own an iPad 2, wait for the 4th to come out. If you're purchasing a new tablet, I'd consider the iPad 2 for $399 16gb or a used one with larger capacity for a cheaper price. Or the nexus 16gb for $249. Just remember iPad 2 has no Siri, dictation or other advances present in the iPad 3 due to apple's choice to only include the latest features with the latest iPad.  My jailbroken iPad 2 does Siri and dictation as well as an iPhone 4S and iPad 3. All in all I'm happy with my decision. 64GB of storage is fantastic.If iPad 4 comes with an SD slot, I'll definitely be looking to upgrade in the next year, if not my iPad 2 will be standing with me for the foreseeable future.Make the decision that best works for you.Good luck!

Content: Dead on arrival, but came back to life. What more can I say?  Opened box, doesn't turn on.  Great as a book end or door stop, but not very useful as a tablet.The tablet suddenly turn on two weeks after we got it. I bought it for my daughter and she ended up giving birth a little early and didn't end up being able to deal with it.  It turned on just as she was about to box it up and send it back.

Content: Still hard to beat the iPad. When iPad was first introduced to the world, it was better that sliced better and man walking on the moon. Since then, companies who compete with Apple have released several different kinds of tablets which happen to become very popular BUT none of them can come close to the iPad. Each generation of iPad become smarter, more capable and more useful then that previous version. I got my iPad2 as a Christmas gift and I have been using it every day and I am loving it. Having said all the good thing about the iPad, I am disappointed that iPad does not have retina display like the iPhone but I have heard iPad3 has retina display and that alone will set it far apart from every other tablet. I will definitely recommend it!!

Content: How Apple Rips off their customers when they buy an IPAD. I got my IPAD on Friday as you promised. When I tried to start it up it went to one page and froze there. Even turning it off and on did nothing and as Apple does not bother to send any instructions or Phone numbers to get help except for a high priced Tect service who would not even conect me with a tect untill I gave them a $159.00. I got hung up on twice and it took 5 hours later I got to the beginning of the thing but now since Apple wont take my password and I have forgot my Answers to the Questions I have to wait 48 hours before I get any help. And you know what is so funny Apple took my money and put it on my account but won't let me buy anything.

Content: Sad. Even the iPad is a great device, the apple app store dosn't describe well the applications. For example, I have paid 20 dollars looking for microsoft office app; when I'm going to use it, the 20 dollars' app is really a tutorial to supposedly become an office expert. It was really frustanting. Plus, in order to transer files from my desktop to my iPad, I was charged for another 20 dollars thanks to iTunes download (on my desktop), price that never was ask to my beacuse it said it was free.To sum up, iPad is a great device, but the app store is frustating.

I switched from the ipad 2 tot he ipad 3, I have to say that the ipad 3 isnt much different from the ipad 2, it just has a better camera, voice to message, and a bit faster. That being said i guess I expected a little more for the new generation. But of course I still love the display and what nots. Still a great tablet (the best).

Content: fun, but like a china doll. Let me preface this with the fact that I have been an apple user for decades, but am considering other options. Over the last few years, I have thought about moving on. For example, my new MacBook's battery died within two years (new ones cost about $175!) This iPad was great, but the digitizer (glass) broke and it is extremely fragile. It can cost about $250-$500 to fix (you can get one or two tables for the price of the repair alone). By contrast, Amazon has always replaced my items either for free or at a reduced cost. My first Kindle reader broke due to wear and tear, and they gave me a new one at a reduced price. When the new one broke, they replaced it for free (Apple will never do this unless you pay for apple care, which is more akin to gambling than to customer service). I have had two HP computers through work, and they seemed much more sturdy and the battery lasted longer than my MacBook; and were definitely more reliable than my iPad (which with a cracked screen is basically useless).In terms of fun and the number of apps, the iPad may be better. But in terms of sturdiness, product quality, and the ability to replace when broken, I think the Kindle fire would definitely be a better purchase. For the amount I have spent on the iPad and all of the issues associated with it, I could have had about three fires. It seems like I can get everything in Apple that I can in Amazon (syncing, personal cloud, etc.), except that Amazon is less in terms of dollars, and has better customer service and stands behind their products a lot better. Sorry Apple, but my heart may be moving on to Amazon!

Content: Please read this if you think of buying: Ok, I would like to start by saying that the iPad that my wife got for me has no functional deficits. The reason I am assigning a "1 star" rating to this product is NOT because we bought a defective unit. Nor am I disappointed with the service: every time I went to the Apple Store to get help (and that happened a lot!), a perky 16-year-old would materialize out of thin air and show me how to press the only button available to make the gizmo work.But herein is the rub: if buying an iPad, any iPad, please be aware of its limitations. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A SMALL COMPUTER, WHAT I GOT WAS A LARGE CELL PHONE WITHOUT THE PHONE!PROs:-- it looks cool;-- my kids love it;-- yes, there are a lot of free apps in the AppStore;-- you can check your eMail pretty much anywhere and any timeCONs:-- many "free" iPad apps are "teasers;" i.e. they have limited functions and you have to pay to get a full version of these apps only to discover that they are often faulty;-- NO Java support-- NO Flash media support (although the iPad does come with a free YouTube app)-- NO preloaded apps that would let you manage Word-type documents or Excell-type spread sheets (you have to buy those but, again, once you do, you soon realize that they are nowhere close to the quality of the ones you use on your desktop [Mac or Windows])-- most importantly, there is NO ABILITY TO MANAGE YOUR OWN FILES! This one particular lacking feature drives me to distraction! There are several apps you can BUY that would allow you to manage your OWN files but, again, they are very poorly designed and often do not interact well with iTunes, Windows, or, surprisingly, iPad's own OS system .-- and here is another critical issue: EVERYTHING MUST BE SYNC'd via iTunes. If you are running a Windows desktop, this may be (and in my case indeed IS) a serious problem. Things purchased via iTunes, iStore, AppStore, etc, usually manage to get to your iPad unscathed. Other content (e.g. I am an eBook fan and purchase my eBooks in multiple places on the Net) are not so fortunate. Although, Apple's iBook app is free and allows you to use both .pdf and .ePub formats (you can also install a free Kindle app for .mobi books),  actually getting your books onto your iPad may be difficult, if not impossible. You cannot "drag-and-drop" your book files (or any other files) onto your iPad. Everything MUST BE SYNC'd with iTunes, an app called "DropBox," or some other app. If your iTunes does not get along with your desktop (usually a PROBLEM FOR WINDOWS users like me),  you will end up spending endless grim nights uninstalling iTunes, re-installing iTunes, wiping your iPad clean, sync'ing and re-sync'ing your iPad again, and again, and again.-- The Camera is OK, but keep in mind that all your videos will be in .mov format and may not play on all desktops --you will need a special converter to re-code the formats for non-Apple media players; you will need to install "Quick Time for Windows" on your desktop if you are running Windows.-- finally, there is noway to increase the amount of memory for the device as there is NO slot for a memory expansion card. I can't believe it! Every tablet has it BUT iPad. So you are pretty much stuck with 16 gB, 32 gB, or 64 gB tablet without ever having any hope of expanding!OVERALL :  I feel so bad that my wife spent all that money, time, and effort to get me this. I feel awful that her loving good intentions made us spend ~ $900 for something that turned out to be just an appallingly expensive toy, poorly engineered, thoughtlessly designed, and very frustrating to use. (The MSRP is ~ $600 - 700, but there are sales tax, additional warranty, front cover, back cover, USB attachments, and other apparel that one needs for this thing, hence the enormous price!)  The good thing is: it is possible to easily re-set it back to factory settings. And we still have the original box. I think it will make a great (and a VERY EXPENSIVE) Christmas gift for my in-laws. For Windows users (like me): please, think hard before sinking all that money into this purchase! Again, keep in mind, this is NOT a small and portable computer, IT IS ESSENTIALLY A SmartPhone WITHOUT THE PHONE!... just a bit bigger, though...

The product works well but it was embarrassing when my niece turned on the Ipad and there were 350 contacts, previous owner's inbox was full, face time account existing, etc...

Content: Good product, good deal. This is a good product and a very good deal, but I must say that the battery life is somewhat shorter than I expected. That being said, it is still worth the price and for non extreme gamers or heavy database app users the iPad 3 is an excellent deal compared to the version 4 for the money. For those without the need for a faster CPU, I would shop for an available version 3.

I expressed my disappointment to both the EDealer and Amazon.  It was taken care of quickly, effectively and too my liking.  I did have one more issue as the cable and wall charger did not work, it drained the battery instead of charging it...I purchased a new set for $26 and all is fine.  I will continue to do business with Amazon.  Their customer services excels over all other on line businesses I have dealt with.

Content: The only option for aviation apps. I bought my iPad 3 for using aviation apps in my airplane. The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.

Needs a pretty good Wi-Fi signal though or else it looses contact with the web.  Would I pay this much again.  I doubt it.

Content: Good product but easily broken. My first Ipad purchased was a black 32 mg mini.  I bought it at the Apple store because it cost much less than here and my name was engraved free.  I really like this mini. I can put it in my handbag and take it with me without needing a big bag to put it in.  I purchased the leather case sold on amazon to go with it as the magnetic case from apple is not much good.  Pretty useless actually.I am glad I waited on this mini as downloads and playing games going to FB or wherever is so easy.  I gave this a five because I really like this product.Update:OK, so I dropped it on the floor.  I go to apple care and they say it is under warranty but I really didn't buy that at all. And I was right.  Here are the steps for repair.  You try and navigate the apple care site, get a repair id, take the ipad to UPS Store and they wrap it and send it overnight to Apple.  Apple gets it and says, oh it is damaged with a cracked screen and you must pay $241.77 for us to repair.  I say ok.  I go online and pay the $241.77 to repair the glass.  They send another email a couple days later and say we didn't hear from you so we shipped it back unrepaired.  I call apple care.  They say, we see the emails and the payment we don't know what happened but let me connect you to a supervisor who can suggest a couple things.  After being on the phone 20 minutes with them they have the dude call me back and he says, I don't think I can intercept the ipad but if you will send it back we will repair it.  I said look, I already had to drive 10 miles to a UPS store and paid $241.77 only to be told it was returned unrepaired. There was no solution offered to me only that I could call this manager back.  I said for what.  You had your chance and I am disgruntled with apple and expected a whole lot more from Apple.  The moral to this story is forget their repair center.  IT STINKS!  I understand my town has a company that repairs for the same amount with a two hour wait.  That would have been a lot easier.

Content: Amazing tablet! I was hesitant about purchasing the iPad Mini due to it being a smaller iPad 2 (spec wise) and the lack of the retina display.  However I was in need of a tablet after getting rid of my older iPad (due to size).  And after considering the other options in the same size range I picked this one up due to having so much money invested on apps and other iTunes goodies.  I didn't want to repurchase the same apps, or similar apps, again on another store.The size is perfect.  I have never owned a retina display device but have seen one and really wish that this had it, however it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  Speed wise, I have not had an issue.  I own an iPhone 4s and it is on par with it.  I don't do heavy gaming.  Mostly work productivity and reading, as well as the occasional Netflix/Hulu.The only thing I want people to beware is that many sellers are increasing the price of the iPad Mini and I wanted to warn consumers to not waste there money.  Apple and other websites sell the iPad Mini at MSRP ($329 for the 16 GB WiFi only model) and free shipping.  I can't imagine why other places are selling it for $70-100 more and charging for shipping.

Content: Best size!! I hope It would come with retina screen. I chose the mini model because of its size. It's way better and more comfortable than her bigger sister. The only down side is that the screen is not the bet Apple has to offer. Bummer.

Content: No ethernet or keyboard...no memory card... Not sure what they were thinking here because it renders the device basically unusable.However, there is a camera that I use to take pictures of my cats.  I cannot figure how to get them off the device so as a workaround I display the photo I want on screen and take a picture of the screen with a Kodak disposable camera and get the pictures developed at Walgreens.  Works like a charm, hence the 5 star review.

Content: Apple seems to really milk us for all the money they can. There is a lot of things not working on my ipad mini and when I call apple for help, apple wanted more money before they would give me any advice on how to work my iPad mini. My iMessage & ICloud wouldn't work and still isn't working, I'm refusing to pay more money for something I've already paid more than enough already. On top of that it seems an ipad is very limited to what an ipad can actually be used for. You will still need a regular laptop or home computer for most things, for iPad doesn't allow, which is A Lot!. iPad mini is basically a big mobile unit. It's not looked at as a laptop. It would be better to buy a lap top than a iPad!!!!! iPad is a empty money pit that doesn't end, it's like buying a used car.

Content: BE AWARE, the wifi-only Mini does not have a GPS chip. I'm wishing I'd made a smarter decision on my iPad Mini purchase. I'm regretting it now. Not because it isn't a nice device. But because it lacks a GPS chip. I decided I could live with the low res display and and the iPhone 4S internals. But I didn't know I couldn't navigate with it.I bought a car dock designed for the smaller tablets and was getting ready for some cool navs with my Mini. I tethered it (mine's a wifi-only) to my phone and proceeded to run a route. Unfortunately it wasn't working well. It wasn't following my course or refreshing. Had to be the data signal on my phone or lower spec'd GPS hardware in the Mini, I told myself. After troubleshooting it online I discovered Apple chose not to equip the wifi-only Mini with a GPS chip.Now I'm saddled with a lackluster experience from my brand new iPad Mini. It's still a nice device. Just not a happy-inducing

Content: Ok but not thrilled. Well this ipad mini is nice - clear bright screen, every bit as nice as a full sized ipad.  Except the wi-fi.  I got this to save my back - so I wouldn't have to carry my laptop to work.  But I'm pretty disappointed in the wi-fi.  It has less connection ability than my husband's kindle fire.  The only way I can use it at work, or even in the bedroom at home, is to use my iphone as a mobile hotspot.  It will not and can not connect to my home network or work network - doesn't seem to have the connection range as the kindle fire or my laptop.  If I hadn't already "moved into" it, I'd be returning it.  I am not happy with the very limited connection range.

Content: Not retina display, half resolution, smaller processor. I'm really disappointed with some characteristics of Apple products and sometimes I thing resellers don't let you aware of it purposely. This iPad mini model MD531LL/A is NOT RETINA, there is a huge difference between a retina display and this one. At apple store I was able to see that I made a terrible mistake purchasing this model at Amazon thinking Amazon may have a better price by an agreement but it's because the product is old. The newer version of iPad mini cost about $345 at apple store and I paid $315 for the half resolution model. Hum.. Maybe the fault is mine, I agree.

Content: Nice tablet. I have both this tablet and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 (32 G with 4 G A.T.&T.;)  Both are great tablets.  I bought the "fire" at the beginning of the year after comparing it and the mini.  The Amazon deal was too good to pass up.  The price was the final determining factor when I purchased my Fire HD 8.9 at the beginning of the year. I have had the mini for a few weeks now and I certainly enjoy it.  For one thing, it is easier to slip into my purse.  It is lighter and smaller than the "fire". The podcasts I enjoy are not available with the "fire", but I could listen to them on my iPhone 5.  BUT, I must say, overall, I like my Fire HD 8.9 best.  If I were to purchase a tablet today (and could only have one tablet) my choice would be the new Fire HDX 7 inch.  I also would consider the 16G. With cloud storage, it is possible to get along with the 16G.  However, the price difference for the 16G and 32G is certainly more reasonable with the Fire than the iPad. Dollar for dollar Amazon has knocked this one out of the ball park.  The price point is affordable and the tablet is great!!!!  So, watch out Apple, Amazon's Fire HD series is a real competitive contender and certainly more reasonably price.

Content: SIM card and reset. The iPad mini was in great condition.  But, it didn't come with a SIM card, and after contacting the seller, I had to go to an AT&T; store to request one.  Then the iPad mini still couldn't get service and the store couldn't help me.  AT&T; salesman gave me a help number.  I called it and they helped me restore the Internet function to factory defaults.  I feel the seller should have taken those steps already.  I am not really an IT person, so it was frustrating to me as I didn't  know these steps.  Otherwise, the sale and delivery were good.

Content: Adobe flash player does not work. I have recently bought this tablet from Amazon. This is my first tablet and I didn't want to invest more than $ 150 because I wanted to have some experience and see how much I enjoy using  a tablet before investing more. In fact, I was looking for a portable tablet especially for internet browsing which I could use when I am outdoors by accessing to wifi hotspots instead of connecting to internet with a smaller screen through my smart phone. Of course, pop3 / imap e-mail, a decent capacitive screen and new Ice cream sandwhich os packed up in less than $ 120 made  Coby Kyros mid 7042-4 a charming choice.I received the tablet a few days ago. My first concern right out of the box was the sharp edges which I had read in one of the earlier reviews. The first feeling of the sharpness made me thought, "I shouldn't have bought it". However, playing a little bit with applications and trying to get used to the tablet, I almost forgot about the edges; using the tablet is comfortable and this issue is not at all a deal breaker. Access to Amazon android store and 1mobile are plusses. As I primarily bought the tablet for internet browsing, adobe flash player is indispensable. Although not originally installed, it took only a few minutes to download and install the 11.1.111.9 version of adobe flash player from 1mobile. Then there was the first disappointment! It was not possible to visualize flash videos embedded in web sites. Googling the problem didn't help much: It seemed that this was not a common issue. I visited adobe's test pages which stated that no adobe flash player was found on my device though the tablet settings clearly showed that the flash application was successfully installed. As one of the Amazon reviewers had earlier wrote that adobe flash 11.1.111.5 worked well, I found and installed this earlier version of flash player but this didn't help either. It is not possible to watch videos on websites while interestingly, it is possible to watch you tube videos through the youtube application. I reported this problem to Coby support by e-mail. So far, no reply.  If I won't be able to find a solution to watching videos on websites I am seriously considering to return the tablet as this is a must have for me.Update after two months:- Still no answer to e-mails from Coby support;- Still flash player does not work;- Wi fi capture very weak;- Download function stopped working; Cannot download further applications or media either from getjar or through internet;- Device cannot see the content of the external sd card; if media content is downloaded on the sd card externally, i.e. from pc,  only some of the related applications can see and read such content such as aldiko book reader (for e-books) and mx player (for videos);- Certain applications (other than adobe flash) do not work; cannot reinstall them because downloading does not function;- An option that may at least "hopefully" eliminate some of the above problems is to  proceed with factory reset but (a) this will result in losing all applications and media that I had aşready downloaded and (b) given all the problems I've had with this tablet, I have serious doubts that the tablet will restart after the reset.The above problems call for down-grading to one or two stars.

Content: disappointing. I bought this tablet for my 3 year old son so that I could have my Samsung back. I understand you get what you pay for... but I honestly don't even feel like I got my money's worth. It is built very cheaply and is very clunky in the way  it operates and works. It does not work with Netflix. I upgraded the android os, I added amazon appstore and the best I was able to do was get Netflix for a limited basis. Since this was my primary purpose for it, it did not meet my expectations. I will be spending the money to get him a Samsung tablet and it's quality.

Content: Coby Kyros 10.1. For the price it's an Okay product. Upside - decent screen resolution, relatively easy system navigation and great for reading. Downside - disappointing the operating system does not allow access to Google market. Fix is download of apk file but a pain for a new product based on Android. Speaker sound quality okay but with ear buds no problem.

Content: small disappointment. this is my first review on this tablet in fact this is first tablet ever hence i must in all fairness choose my words carefullyi recently returned this product to amazon because the wifi suddenly stop working i tried what little i could to get it working but to no avail. i did a factory reset and got nothing, i actually made an inquiry on this site and got two responses that kinda aided mw along in my decision to return the tablet. bearing in mind the principle: you get what you pay for i was quite contented with this tablet what should you be expecting for a tab costing under 200. interestingly enough my wife has one also and currently it works like a dream nevertheless amazon dealt with me in a very timely manner i returned the tablet just as i got it in the original packaging and got a full refund after 33 days which i in turn diverted toward another tablet something called a zto 9" i'll let you how that goes the reviews i read are very decent

Content: Great Product. I bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas last year and it has been a great first tablet!! I myself as an adult was very impressed with it. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because it does not come equipped with google play store and it is an android tablet, the market it does come with is called GETJAR and it is horrible! Other than that downfall it has stood up to my 8 year old sons beating and he loves it!!!

Content: It's not the tablet you need to be aware of it is the manufacturer customer service. I am surprised Amazon partners with a company that does not support it's products.  I bought my Coby Kyros in October 2012.  The screen froze so I sent it in for replacement April 11, 2013.  There are only 2 numbers to call 99% of the time you get a busy signal.  It cost me $30 to send it back. Over $15 to ship it to them and a $15 money order so they could send it back.  They tell it takes 6-8 weeks to get the replacement.  It is now June 13 and I have not been able to get through on the phone for over a month to check the status of it.  The only day of the week I have been able to get through is a Monday and had to sit on hold forever.Honestly I loved my tablet and miss it greatly but I would never by another Coby Kyros because of the lack of customer service.  The product is great while it works, but you might as well kiss it goodbye if you have to send it in for a replacement.If you don't believe me try calling these numbers to see if you get through: 1-800-681-2629  or 1-800-727-3592.Best of luck to those who still wish to buy, but to someone who doesn't have money and time to lose keep shopping.If you do decide to get it; the best free app stores to use with this were Amazon and Mobile1 app store.Get Jar was a joke. Hulu Plus did not work on it but Netflix did.  You do not get 4 GB of space for Apps, App space is very minimal and even with a 16 GB SD card still was pretty limited.  I would by more hard core memory because there are quite a few apps you can't send to the SD card.

Content: It's Ok but dont recommend. its a slow tablet and DOES NOT HAVE GOOGLE PLAY so it does not really have good apps to download. I bought it in march for my baby brother and the only thing he really uses it for is Netflix and youtube because it doesn't have good apps for kids.I really would NOT recommend this tablet but in the end its really up to the person buying it.

Content: Broke within weeks. Bought one and it broke within weeks - just went dead while charging. But sent it in and got another one promptly (must be refurbished), but it works a lot better and customer service was good. Doesn't crash and the web browser views websites correctly unlike my first one.As for performance, it has a single core so it does lag sometimes. Also, it doesn't have Google Play and the more you use Amazon Apps and GetJar the more you miss Google Play or Apple's App store. Also, GetJar downloads are not working for me for some reason and Amazon emails you for every free app you download like its a purchase.The screen, sound, and memory are all on par with the other options for its size and price. I like the design, it is thinner and lighter than others and has multiple color options although the colors are brighter and not metallic like they look in the pictures. Its wifi does not pick up the signal nearly as well as an IPad or an Iconia - I know they are much more expensive and its not fair to compare it to those but internet connectivity is probably the most important part of a tablet.Overall, it works pretty well but I still cannot recommend it to anyone. With all the tablet competition it is still too expensive. You can get a dual core with Google Play for just a little more and sometimes even the same price or cheaper if you really hunt sales. Also, even though the customer service seemed above average, from my experience it is annoying and an extra expense to send it back in if you are unlucky enough to get a faulty one (I have seen other reviews with my same issue). Finally there are basically no accessories - here are no screen protectors or skins available for this item.
