Content: Excellent laptop-replacement tablet. I've extensively used a lot of tablets, due to both longtime interest in mobile technology, and my line of work.  To give you an idea of my frame of reference, I've either owned or used the following tablets:  Ipad 2 (owned), HP Touchpad (owned - 2011 firesale!), Motorola Xoom / Galaxy Tab 10.1, LG G, original Asus Transformer (work).  Heck, I've owned the following Windows Mobile / PocketPC devices from back in the day - HP Jornada, Toshiba e800.  My phone is the iPhone 4.With that said, this is one of the best tech gadget I've ever owned. The unanimous rave industry reviews (and very positive end user reviewers, even taking wifi issues etc. into account) aren't wrong.* BUILD AND FORM FACTOR: evocative of but actually feels higher quality than the Ipad 2 and Macbook Air, which is a minor miracle at this price point.  Beautifully machined aluminum, minimalist but not cold.  The resolution of the screen is the best out of any current tablet, and can be crazily bright enough that it is useable outdoors in sunlight.  It's definitely a fingerprint magnet though.* COLOR - for those deciding between the gray or champagne, I received the champagne, and I actually called to confirm that I received the right one. It's much more silver than gold, it's basically silver aluminum with some gold highlights when the light catches it the right way.  This is *exactly* what I wanted - it's reminiscent of the classic aluminum MacBook Pros, but with a touch of warmth from the gold.  In short - it's not very gold at all.* PROCESSOR - the Tegra 3 quad core processor is noticeably snappy, making the whole experience (even with Honeycomb) feel next gen.  I've been getting great battery life, ~ 10-12 hours of normal mixed used, on balanced setting.  With the dock, you're at 18+ hours.  The NVIDIA fifth "stealth core" does its job seamlessly.  It just works.  For a quad core tablet with blazing power, this is again pretty mind-bending and next-gen.  Is a quad core necessary?  Strictly speaking, no.  The Tegra 2 / OMAP / Snapdragon tablets do just fine, for the most part (although the un-overclocked Touchpad is noticeably slow), but every non ipad tablet lagged behind the iPad 2 in terms of real world performance (opening menus, browsing, launching apps).  This isn't because Apple's processor is faster, but rather because if the sheer level of optimization between Apple hardware and software, which is industry-leading. With the Tegra 3 processor, though, this is the first non Apple tablet that both objectively is, and also noticeably feels, faster, more responsive, and more powerful than the iPad 2.  It just brute forces past all of the Apple optimizations.  For me, that is huge, especially if I'm going to be spending over $400 on something. Slowly but surely, more and more apps are optimizing for quad core (especially games), but even without that, I'd get a quad core for the general performance benefits alone, as it translates across every app.* OS / SW - I really like the iOS UI for phones, it's simple yet powerful, but for a tablet it's always just felt incredibly limiting / frustrating / slightly condescending.  I even prefer WebOS to it.  Android Honeycomb is a nice balance between power, customization and being relatively easy to pick up, just perfect for the tablet form factor.  My 2 year old toddler figured out how to use it in about 20 seconds (similar to WebOS and iOS).  That being said, I'm looking forward to ICS, which should make things even more stable (HC still crashes occasionally)and uniform. The fact that the Prime gets an ICS in a month or two is fantastic. The pre-loaded Asus apps are relatively minimal and unobtrusive, and some actually are quite nice, such as the Asus cloud.  Polaris Office is solid.  The Android Market could be improved though, especially in terms of sorting and organization.  Finding the right app can be a bit of a crapshoot.CONS: Basically the same nits as others have pointed out.* SPEAKER:  the rear-facing speaker placement is a bit dumb, because it gets covered up relatively easily by your hands or when you set it down.  However, you can still hear it even if it's completely covered, it's pretty loud, and it's located where the tablet tapers inwards so it doesn't get completely covered by a flat surface when setting it down.  I don't mind the lack of a second speaker per se, as you hardly get stereo sound from any of the other tablets that have two speakers.  I would say the sound quality of the Prime is on par with any other tablet, but it is just a bit easier to muffle.  A jawbone jambox bluetooth speaker or the like works beautifully to supplement this tablet.  It's certainly not needed, but it's a nice addition.* CHARGER - the proprietary charger really annoys me.  Until Asus comes out with more accessories, I'm basically stuck with using my one charging cord.  Even charging via the dock requires the proprietary connector.  It's not worth deducting a star for (at least for me), because it's more of an annoyance in light of how great the rest of the device is, but sheesh.* PRODUCT LAUNCH - for a $21 billion company of 110,000+ employees, Asus still can't do a good product launch to save its life.  This doesn't detract from the end product per se, but it's worth mentioning because so many pre-orders (on Amazon and elsewhere) were bungled or delayed.  Asus is starting to consistently put out really great products, but in order to get to the "next level"(Sony, Apple etc.) in the eyes of the average consumer, they're going to really need to work on marketing and sales execution.OVERALL: this thing is pretty ingenious, especially with the accessory dock / keyboard.  Hopefully a harbinger of good things to come in the Android tablet space.<<UPDATES AS OF 1/24/2012>>These are discussed more in the comments, but I thought it would be useful to update the main review.* ICS - I updated to ICS the first day it was out (good job Asus in pushing this out two days earlier), to absolutely no problems.  It was like any other firmware update.  The system notifies you that there's an update available, you tap yes, and voila.  ~10 minutes later, ICS is installed.  It's pretty seamless - no loss of applications or data.  I haven't noticed wholesale differences, but everything is smoother, more streamlined, and sometimes faster.  It's a definite plus.  Asus has already provided multiple firmware updates (on top of ICS), which is a very good sign that this product is being actively supported.* WiFi - it's been pretty definitively proven that an all-aluminum back-plate is not the best for enhancing WiFI signals.  Asus attempted to make up for this via "antenna differentiation," a fancy way for saying that there are two antennas instead of one.  In practice, mine has very good wifi reception up to about 25-30 feet from the router.  Specific numbers: wifi analyzer average value of -50 to -60, and speedtest of up to 18mbps, exactly on par with my laptop.  However, once you get really far away from the router (i.e. outside, or more than 75 feet from the router), the performance erodes at a higher rate than the comparison laptop (wifi analyzer -90).  For my purposes, this is extremely useable, and I never noticed the supposedly weak wifi until I started doing actual tests out of curiosity. A lot of people have had luck with installing repeaters and / or more powerful routers, but I haven't needed to go that route.  Asus has announced that they're making a new Transformer Prime variant, the 700T, due in a few months (supposedly).  This one will have a different, non-metallic backplate, similar to the original Transformer (i.e. plastic).  For me, I'm happy to sacrifice a slight amount of WiFi range for the distinctive spun-aluminum backplate; those who don't feel this way should perhaps wait for the 700T if they can.* Dock - my champagne dock finally shipped yesterday, about a month after the actual tablet arrived.  I can understand this somewhat if this device were sold out by the millions, but I don't think that that's the case (even though it looks like this tablet is, deservedly, a hit as far as Android tabs go).  It's just an almost mind-bogglingly bad manufacturing / supply issue with Asus.  It's like they make 10 at a time and call it a day.  Hopefully it's just the first month hiccup - it looks like there are more docks (esp. the grey) among different retailers and that's a good sign.  My original criticism stands though - Asus is insanely bad at product launches.* Accessories - I ended up purchasing this MoKo(TM) Premium Quality Slim-Fit Folio Cover Case with built-in Multi-Angle Stand for Asus Eee Pad Transformer Prime TF201 10.1-Inch Android Tablet, and the Skinomi Techskin screen protector.  The case is not as whiz-bang as some iPad cases - it's the same tired black pseudo leather, but it's cheap and it gets the job done in terms of functionality.  The skin is ok but seems to, ironically, scratch easily.  I've had better luck with Invisibleshield with past devices.* Overall - I'm pleased to report that the tablet is still working great.  After a month of use, I'd say what really sets it apart is the Tegra 3 quad core, which is an unadulterated good.  I can't imagine using a tablet without one now.  The form factor and build are great, but with the caveats noted above.

Content: WOW!  This is a tablet? The only limitation is your imagination.  THere are so many nooksto explore, so many colors to absorb, sounds to excite and much,much more.  I'm surprised it doesn't cost more.  I like the fourwork areas, the Google voice for searches, the pictures are outstanding.If you cup your hand over the speaker, the should will travel towardsthe front.  I use a bluetooth headset, as well.  And the gadgets!  This ismuch more sophisicated and thought out, than an iPad.  This is thoughtfulness at its best and very intuitive to use.  Wow.... is theonly exclamation one can use...... keyboard @ CDW.com for $122.99!I keep getting 'Android Task Manager' has quit!  Plus my internet speed keepdropping off and the screen jiggers once in awhile.  Mine is going back.I'm waiting for the prime with a build in cellphone.  Maybe it will be better.

Content: Fabulous Tablet. I've had the Prime for about 3 days now and this thing is awesome.  I've had no problems with it.  No light bleed, no wifi issues.  Constantly hitting around 15-16 Mbps down and 6 up.  Everything with this is quick, and battery life lasts all day for me.  With the update to ICS coming next week, we'll see how well this thing really runs!  Now the GPS doesn't pick up a signal without being on wifi, which I could care less about.  I would  not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, but CES is coming up the next latest and greatest will be coming out soon!Update:  just got ICS upgrade and this thing really moves now!  I think Asus should have put this out in the beginning and had enough supply for their launch!

Content: Most of my concerns were unfounded. Update 1/11/12: Well, I promised an update when ICS was released but unfortunately my Prime has the dreaded "Serial Number Unknown" issue, and can't be updated OTA. I had to return it to Best Buy, and there are no more in stock. I still like the Prime, and plan on getting my hands on another one as soon as possible. Be advised though. There seem to be a lot of Primes being shipped with this major issue. :(------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:I've had a chance to play with the Asus Transformer Prime for a few days now, and I'm very impressed. I was going to wait until next week when the Android 4 ICS update comes out, but I decided to give a brief review in it's current stage.First Impressions: Out of the box, the Prime has the look and feel of quality built tablet. The thinness really surprised me since my other tablets are at least twice as thick. Before doing anything, I charged the Prime fully. The first boot took about 90 seconds. My Prime came with firmware .27, which I updated to the latest .33. After updating and getting everything setup, the Prime would boot in under a minute.Screen: Simply put, it's bright and beautiful. I do not have any noticeable light bleeding.Wifi: This is where I was most concerned. My concerns seem to be unfounded. My Wifi works fine. My router (an older FiOS Actiontec "G") is located on the 2nd floor. I get a good signal throughout my house, including my basement. Throughput is fine, and my connection never drops.GPS: First let me say that I could care less about this because I'll never use my Prime not connected to Wifi, but for the purposes of this review, I did test it. The first test was indoors, and as expected the results were not good. I could get an occasional satellite lock, but it would disconnect. I then went outside and I made sure Wifi was disabled. With a clear view of the sky, the Prime got a satellite lock in around 30 seconds. The GPS seems to work fairly well if you're outdoors and have a clear view of the sky. It remained locked, and Google Maps knew exactly where I was. Depending on your plans for the GPS, it is a mixed bag. If you're planning on using it for navigation in your vehicle, you'll probably be disappointed. If you want to use it outdoors with apps such as Google Maps, or Google Sky Map, then it works OK.Battery: Battery life was good. My first charge lasted about 8 hours. After some tweaking and subsequent charges, I now get around 10 hours.Cameras: The 8MP rear camera has 1080P video capture and is a great performer. It takes excellent pictures in good light, and is the best I've seen on an Android tablet or phone. I haven't taken much video, but from what I have taken, it looks very good.  The front 1.2MP camera is perfect for video conferencing, etc.Performance: Performance is excellent as expected. The Tegra 3 doesn't disappoint even though most apps aren't optimized for it. All the apps I use open noticeably faster than my Tegra 2 based tablet. The screen is quick and responsive, and I haven't noticed any lag. I use Dolphin HD as my browser, and the stock keyboard. There is the occasional "app crash", but this is almost always related to Android 3 "Honeycomb", not the Prime's hardware. The vast majority of current apps are written for compatibility with phones and Android 2.x, not the "tablet only" Android 3.x. In 2012, Android 4.x "ICS" will solve this problem, as the same operating system will once again be used for both new phones and new tablets.Overall: I'm completely satisfied. Wifi was my only real concern, and it works just fine for me. The Asus Transformer Prime looks beautiful, and is blazing fast. My only caveat would be if the GPS is very important to you. Since its limitations appear to be hardware related, I wouldn't expect any major improvements to it. I'll update my review when the Android 4.x ICS update comes out next week, and when/if Asus makes any major improvements/fixes.

Content: Transformer Prime Rocks. Issues:  I have found that the device will get bogged down if you dont know how to close you webpages or apps.  Also there is definitely some light bleed from the side of the screen with the headphone jack on it, and putting pressure on that side will make it worse.  Personally though, I don't find these things to be that much of an issue because I dont get uptight about little things.  The first issue is a software thing that can be fixed the other is hardware, but not something I personally would care to much about.  GPS is not in my realm of concern as I would never use a tablet of this size in this manner.  However, I can see this being a problem for some.Awesomeness:  This device is my first Andriod so my opinion cannot be judged vs. other andriod devices.  I did have an itouch and I can say I will never go back to Apple ever again.  This device is smooth and a pleasure to use.  I have not had any wifi issues at all.  Movies stream very nicely and games are just insane.  Using the web is also very nice and it is nice to not have to use an app to watch video content.  Battery life is very good and not disaapointing at all.  I'm looking forward to more Tegra3 optimized apps.  Its going to be a good year.  The speaker has plenty sound, but its nice to have a headphone jack.  IMO the positives outweigh any minor negatives so I'm glad to give this device 5 stars.

Content: GPS is Useless. Loved the transformer but just returned it.  I really wanted to use it in my car as a GPS device.  My wife was excited about using it as a Navigator and Point of interest finder while I did the driving.  The big screen would make the experience much easier than looking at a tiny cell phone screen.  Unfortunately,ASUS screwed up the design of the unit and the metal backing blocks the GPS signals.When I was in Vegas last week the Prime kept insisting we were in Ohio!I think if you are paying premium prices for a tablet, everything should work on it.So I returned it.  The good news is that ASUS will have a new unit out in 2nd quarter that will have a plastic back.  This will eliminate the GPS and WI-Fi issues.  I will repurchase it then.Other problems:  Every video I've tried from my collection. (movies TV shows etc) had to be converted to a special format in order to play on the Prime.  My PC can play dozens of formats why can't the Prime?

Content: Asus lost my business forever. Well Asus has lost my business forever and possibly Amazon also for that matter for allowing a crap product like this to be released. It seems to me and I understand that there are bad units during production but to have 90% of the units go out and ship to customers when it was a known problem back in Nov. I'm not sure what Asus was thinking that customers would just ignore the fact that there product just doesn't work as advertised and forget about it is... well I can't think of the words I'm trying to come up here. Asus... good bye and good luck to your future if you have one. Your a lieing ass cheap no tech support company. At least admit it for once.Andy.

Content: After a couple of hours... I must say, I am very excited about this tablet.  It is my first, and I pre-ordered in December, so I received it about a week ahead of schedule, very nice start!When I booted for the first time, Ice Cream Sandwich was ready for install, took about 10 minutes (this thing IS powerful).  Fit and finish are very very nice.  The speed is incredible.If you want the absolute state of the art, this is your tablet.

Content: Exceeded expectations. Picked up the Asus Transformer Prime 64GB a few days ago and so far it has been a great experience. I have not ran into any of the problems previously commented by other users. WiFi has been strong no matter where Ia m in the house and GPS as worked perfect. Updated to Ice Cream Sandwich quickly and it runs smooth as silk. More than enough apps to choose from and the biggest plus is the ease of customization. It is very thin and light and the screen is bright and sharp. I could not be happier and will be buying the keyboard dock as soon as they are available. Try one for yourself, you will not regret it.

Content: I don't ususally review products. I've had prime (tabby) for about 30 days.  In that time I can say I've gotten lots of compliments on a great screen, and build design, several people went to buy one after seeing mine.  The Tegra 3 is a beast, this is the first tablet that's closer to a computer and less like a phone in part due to the power provided by the Tegra 3.  Now its up to software designers to release "real" software, like dreamweaver and all of the creative suite.  I love typing on this thing, landscape is great for two hands, portrait allows you to type with two thumbs.  The viewing angles are excellent and important as part of the reason for such a tablet is for sales.  The micro hdmi out port provides a useful setup for meetings.The wifi is as good as any other device I own and significantly better than the droid x.  I believe the diversity antennas do a good job.  However the GPS on my unit is completely useless even in wide open outdoor areas. I have set up my phone to tether GPS data to the tabby although I don't utilize it often (ever) for navigation.  UPDATE: ASUS to provide free GPS dongles to all, and improved RF after the C3 models.ICS on this sandwich is awesome, very stable.  Able to multitask seamlessly.  The browser still needs work - I think a high performance mode would be useful. I toggle plugins on demand and tabby does a great job.  The resolution seems more than adequate for me although if a tf201- tf700 upgrade path was made available I might consider it.  ICS kills ad-hoc networking beware.  Tethered with an LTE device this thing flies.The construction is slvete, connections will leave some exposure and I often baby the device by not using it while charging.  BTW the batteries are excellent.  I will say that there is a slight click if I press down on several areas of the screen and/or back.  Nothing to make me send it back, but something I will look out for.  I got the dock some time later.  Didn't think I'd use it, but I was wrong.  It turns this thing into a highend ultrabook.I have to say I'm surprised how much I enjoy and use tabby.  I am a little disappointed with how much personal information google tries to digest.  Really google you need to know all my applications even the ones I installed on my own?  Really, Google I can't delete or reset that information.  Really google I can't stop using Google Play because half of my apps are authenticated through it, but I'm getting really close to deleting my account-- I'm not sure that will stop google from compiling data on you though, just in different ways.

Content: I wanted to love it... Okay, I've ordered and returned two of these now, both from Amazon. I waited a month for the first and when it finally arrived, it was damaged; the box had clearly been dropped. Since the shipping box was undamaged, this had to have happened at the Amazon warehouse. Poor quality control by Amazon, but I really couldn't hold that against the actual tablet. When Amazon managed to get more in stock, I ordered again. There was not visible damage to the table this time, so I charged it up. I started it up, synced with my google account and exchange email, and then noticed the dead pixel. I tried a pixel fixer app (let it run for more than an hour), which did not fix the problem. Then I noticed that the vibrate function did not work, the tablet vibrated on boot, but would not vibrate at any other time- for notifications, with screen touches, etc- regardless of adjustments in system or application settings. Then the UI crashed a couple of times. Apps crashed (believe it or not, weather.com was especially bad). Then I tried to surf the web- the browser is slow, clunky and really struggled with pages that had a lot of Flash-based content. Then it stopped syncing with my exchange email-even after a full reboot, no email.On a positive note, the touchscreen was very responsive (except when the browser was misbehaving), and other than the dead pixel, the screen really did look nice. My GPS worked outside, although it took forever to link. The wifi wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. It did not compare to either of my laptops, but was pretty much on par with my droid x.The dead pixel thing appears to be a common problem (as are poor wifi and non-functional GPS). The other issues I've had may be more due to ICS than the hardware- I can't say. Either way, for $500 I expect a device to simply work, and the Transformer Prime did not do that for me.

Content: Really enjoying the 32 GB  Prime. This is my first tablet and so far it seems to be working as advertised.  Had a 64 GB model ordered for a month and was still looking at another week to three weeks before scheduled delivery.  Kept checking Amazon several times a day to see if anything on its site changed and just happened to see that Amazon was selling a few 32 GB Primes for regular price.  I immediately ordered one.  They did not last long.  That was on Wednesday.  It was not suppose to ship until Friday, but it shipped a day early.  As I had signed up for one day shipping, it was at my door on Friday - three days earlier than expected.  Good job Amazon.I have read most, if not all, of the reviews of this tablet on Amazon's site and am aware of the several problems purchasers have reported.  So far I have experienced none of them.  I plugged in the power supply right off and then started using the device while it was charging.  The battery appeared to be partially charged already and it only took a few hours before it showed that it was fully charged.  After I figured out how to connect to my wifi, the tablet reported that updates were available, which downloaded and installed without a problem.  I spent a good six to seven hours on the tablet after receiving it and I had no wifi problems, reboots, or crashes.  Have not tried to see how many GPS satellites it can lock onto.  I do not foresee using that feature to any great degree.As others have stated, it has a really great screen and the tablet is quite thin.  It would have been nice if it had been lighter.  Holding it to read for long stretches is out of the question.  I have a really light six inch ereader that has spoiled me.  However, the ereader is no good for PDF files, but the Prime displays them beautifully.So far I am loving this tablet.  I will update after I play with it some more or if it encounters problems.  Being that it is my first tablet, I still have a lot to learn about it.April 21, 2012:I have had this tablet for two and one-half months now and have been using it most everyday.  I love it.  I have had no problems with it.  I use it mostly to read ebooks, online news, check email, Youtube, Facebook, and a few other duties.  It only has three games on it so I am not a big game player.  It continues to work like a charm.  I generally leave it in sleep mode when not using it.  Occasionally, when it seems to slow down, I will turn it off and restart it.  I do not know if resources are being tied up or not but restarting it solves those problems.  That has not happened but a few times though.I have an ebook reader which works fairly well, but it sometimes takes a number of seconds to load an ebook or advanced to another section, so it is really nice having this tablet and being able to load ebooks, advance and backup either pages or chapters in but a brief moment.I have not used the GPS feature, so its weakness does not bother me.  Sometimes the signal indicator for Wi-fi shows a weak signal, but it always continues to work.  I have my wireless router fairly centrally located, so I am not ever too far away.  Sometimes the signal has to pass through some furniture and a wall or two, but that is about it.  I probably should download an app to test the signal to see how much it is affected when the indicator shows that it is weak.Overall, I am still loving this tablet and have no complaints about it.

Content: One happy camper. I am very much liking this Tablet and its keyboard. I have been critical testing the GPS, bluetooth and wifi strengths and see no problem at all. All these match with my HTC Thunderbolt. The tablet is beautiful in design and very comfortable to use. Oh, I almost forgot that it also hauls butt and no battery problems doing it. I would recommend this Tablet to anyone.

Content: Perfect. First off if you want to buy one DO NOT PAY MORE THAN 499.99 for 32Gb. I bought mine from GameStop because people were selling theirs on here with jacked up prices. The MSRP is 499.99 and 599.99 for the 32Gb and 64Gb respectively, and the docks are 149.99.  If you go on ASUS's store and look at the accessories that will give you the max you should pay for them.  Anyways, this tablet is top of the line end of story. The quad core Tegra 3 gives great performance and great battery life.  The tablet can output thru the micro-HDMI port full 1080p and 3D for certain games, tested the 3D on my friends TV and no hiccups or performance issues.  The screen is amazing also the IPS+ will be great for those summer days when im working on my projects outside, I have done some rough simulations indoors but I cant wait to see how it does in the noon sun of the Midwest.  Size wise it is thin and light, physically thinner and lighter than the iPad 2 but trust me you wont notice. The camera's are good don't expect professional quality but they can hold there own with any tablet on the market.  The battery life is great I squeezed out 16 hrs today (no WiFi, Bluetooth, no back-light and on power saver mode) but on the average i get 11-13 hrs, about 7-8 hrs when im playing games that use the full potential of the Nvidia Tegra 3.  Overall this is the best tablet I have tested, i loved it so much I bought one even tho ASUS is coming out with a revision in about 3-6 months (ASUS Transformer TF700)that has a full 1080p display.  Honestly I don't need a 1080p display on my tablet a) all my stuff on my computer is 720p which works fine with the Prime's display b) you're not going to notice much difference on a 10.1" display other than 1080p files are going to be larger and c) its 100$ more.Overall great product. the only con i have about it is that amazon(us) didn't sell it, only amazon Canada did, and no I am not going to count the people or companies selling the prime thru amazon since they are not ASUS registered sellers.Update 1 year later with JB (4.1 waiting on 4.2):still the best tablet on the market in my opinion sure you don't have the stylus oops I mean S-pen as the notes but the killer feature is its keyboard dock, I average about 18-20 hrs running videos and over 20 doing simple tasks. the only down side is its wifi but its not as bad as people make it out to be.  Sure its not as sensitive as the newer ones but really there's not much difference, all the area's that are dead with my prime is dead with my friends infinity and speeds are comparable ~2%. ASUS has really worked hard on making the wifi and the GPS better and they have improved greatly since day 1.  Overall performance is still great even tho there are newer and shinier tablets, but the tegra 3 is showing its age with the tegra 4 coming soon, can you say xbox 360/PS3 graphics on a tablet?  finally I have read people complaining that the graphics look no different than on their phone, all I have to say is look for games labeled "THD" (tegra HD) they bring out the most of a tegra device, standard games like "where's my perry" or "shadowgun" are designed for all android systems but "ShadowGun THD" is going to be better since it was developed with the tegra in mind.  Just because you put an ps1 game in a ps3, doesnet make the game have ps3 graphics and physics, same applies for apps.

Content: Great tablet. I've been following the reviews on this tablet for a long time, even while I own the tablet.  I was a little worried when purchasing the tablet but I've come to find out that the best way to figure it out is to buy it yourself.  I'm a simple person who uses this for surfing the web, reading, YouTube and some games.  For all of these things this tab works great and I have no problems what so ever.  My wi-fi works just fine, even after going to the ground level of my apartment, yes the signal drops a bar or two but surfing the web is still fast.  The screen on this thing is amazing, I read comics all day at work and the 16:9 ratio really works for me, a lot better than an Ipad which is what the girlfriend has.  Having a total of 5 processers really helps this thing blaze thru all the window screens and the flash content for the websites I go on which is great.  I've only had one crash and I've had the prime for about three weeks.  ICS is great and ASUS seems to be pushing firmware almost every other week.  I guess my only problem with this thing is that ASUS calls purple tint gray...It's really no big deal because I have a case for it but I really wish it was a gray not a purplish gray. Also remember to charge the battery a full 8 hours before use,  my lord was that a hard thing to do but now I go about two and a half days on the battery and I use this thing all day at work doing some reading, watching videos and surfing the web and then I go home and do the same thing.In short I really do think that if your interested in this tablet then go for it.  Amazon has a 30 day return policy and the fact that I didn't pay taxes for this made me get 2 day shipping.  I paid $511 on Amazon with two day shipping rather than going to a Best Buy and spending $535 after tax.  I would've gotten next day for $521 but I wouldn't have been home when the tablet was delivered.

Content: Really pleased. I have been considering purchasing a tablet since the original transformer was announced last Spring.  I am glad I waited for the Prime, as I feel it is something powerful enough to grow with me in the years ahead.Pros:- The biggest advantage of the prime is the option to add the keyboard.  It really adds a level of versatility that is currently not matched by anything on the market.  Feel like just browsing around the web or checking email?  Use it as a tablet.  Need to write longer emails or documents?  Attach the keyboard and you have a laptop that is considerably lighter than any laptop I've used.- Battery life is really impressive.  I've been blown away.  It lasts for days.  As in, I charge it Monday and it still has a charge on Friday.  To get these results, I'm obviously not using it constantly, but for my nightly email and blog reading, it's great.  The keyboard has it's own battery that charges the Prime when attached.  Together, the Prime lasts about 16 hours which is 6 hours longer than any tablet available.- The screen is very sharp, and the ability to turn the IPS mode on and off (and with just two taps) makes it that much more easy to use.- The Tegra 3 processor really hums.  I have played a few games and it has no problem keeping up.  Also, I am able to browse with more tabs opened in my browser than I can on my netbook.- Android ICS Operating System is a great user experience.  I love all of the flexibility Android allows, and firmly believe it's the best mobile operating system right now.  As a gmail user, I absolutely love the built in Gmail app which is better than either the web page or what's available on non-Android tablets.- Great support from Asus.  Early on, some units were having stability issues.  Mine was one of them.  Asus was on help forums reaching out to customers, letting them know they were working on a fix.  I'm happy to say that after 2 weeks, my Prime received an OS update and I haven't had any problems since.Cons:- The only real con is the GPS issue.  Many units don't have a functioning GPS.  I don't even know if mine is one, because since it's WiFi only, I have really no use for GPS.  But it's a real issue, acknowledged by Asus, and if GPS is important to you, I would wait until the new Transformer TF701 or 300 come out in the second quarter, if you want a keyboard, or get something else in the mean time.- Supply chain problems also left me waiting a month after my order for mine to arrive.  Not the end of the world, but it's hard to get excited about a product when if you brag to your friends about it, they can't even go get it because it's so hard to find.- The speakers are kinda meh.  There really should be two for stereo.  But really, how often am I using the speakers on a tablet anyway?  On planes, trains, etc, I use headphones, but it's worth mentioning if it's a feature that's important to you.Overall, I think the Prime is a really impressive product.  As a tablet, it allows me to check gmail, read blogs from my reader, and the Washington Post from Press Reader (pre-installed, and really nice) in a great, light, portable form factor.  Add on the keyboard, and now it's a light weight laptop that allows me to review and edit photos on my SD card.  Love it.

Content: DO NOT BUY EEE PAD! DO NOT BUT THE ASUS EEE PAD!!! I received the Eee Pad for Christmas 2011. In the few months I have had the pad, I have had to send for repair twice for the same problem. The system will not power on. According to tech support it is a problem with the mother board. They rebuild it, but it works a few days and then will not power on again. I have spent a ton on shipping and packing materials, not to mention the cost of the pad itself, and I currently have a very expensive paperweight. This is the worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever owned.

Content: Don't hesitate - buy one now! Initially, I was somewhat wary of Android but after weeks of research I decided to buy this tablet. It came with ICS  - Android 4.0x, 32 GB version. I won't boar you with the beauty and aesthetics of the unit - it lives up to all of that. The speed of the tablet is unreal (Tegra 3 - 4/5 cores). It is so fast to respond to screen touch - no lag.  I have not experienced any issues with the wireless network coverage that seemed to plague some of the earlier units - so these later units seem to have addressed the issue. There is a massive amount of applications available.  I would recommend buying a stylus - just saves the screen smudging and makes selecting small text easier than using fat fingers.  Here is what amazed me :  I switched it on, fiddled around with some of the features and looked at "Mynet".  It discovered all my DLNA devices - like the Windows media server and my Bluray players.  So I picked a movie clip from the server and when I went to play it the TF201 asked if I wanted to display it locally (on the tablet) or on my Bluray player. I selected the Bluray player and the TV burst into life.  It's awesome!Why I like it more than the iPad.  Like the iPad it's aimed at end users / the consumer market - but the TF201 can be extensively customized. The cameras are great - just dragging the focus area around is so cool. Movie playback is crisp and clear. Screen handling is fast and responsive and zooming in is just the usual process of pushing fingers apart. I had preconceived ideas that I would not want to use it like regular PC - but I have been using it like a tablet - and for everything else I would use a PC for - including video conferencing on Skype.  If you want to type long winded reviews then yes, use a PC or get the fabulous docking station (just ordered it). It folds flat, extends battery life to 18 hours, has 2 USB slots and a standard sized SD card.Although the 700 model is due out with it's incredible higher res screen sometime (higher res than the iPad HD)in 2Q you won't be disappointed with the TF201 which already has a beautiful screen.Eco-System : iPad has a much bigger after market for accessories in retail stores. Having one current model makes it easier to produce standard sized accessories. You may struggle to find accessories for Android tablets in retail stores because each device has front / back cameras, memory slots, connection ports, etc in different locations - so cases in general are device specific. However, there is a wealth of accessories for the myriad of Android tablets like this Asus tab on-line.In summary - Android is so user friendly, rock solid and flexible.  The Asus' power and performance makes it a winning combination.  I have bags under my eyes  - staying up so late - I can't leave the Asus alone!Update July 3.  We were so impressed we bought another one to stop the arguments about who gets to use it.

Content: Very good, HOWEVER... The Asus Transformer Prime is a very good tablet, it has all of the functionality of a regular tablet, plus some (if you get the dock). It's lightning fast and plays 3d games like they're angry birds on the original iPhone.However, there if one (yes only one) downfall. (Well, maybe two, I'll get to that later. The Wifi connection on the device is a little sketchy. I currently have two "smart" devices (not including my laptop), my Asus Transformer Prime, and my Motorola Triumph.I have a Netgear Router that has an "N" connection, also compatible with "a" "g" and "b". Ok, solid. So the Prime can connect to N connections, therefore it should have lightning fast speeds... no? Well, despite the fact that there is a router probably a solid 30 feet away from me in my office while I'm in my living room, I generally only have one, maybe two bars. Ouch. Data speeds are not as lightning fast as they should be. If I decide to walk into my office though, I'll just about instantaneously get a solid 4 bars. I have yet to try out anything on Speedtest or any equivalents for that matter, but I can tell you from personal experience that there is a noticeable difference.Now, let's get back to my Motorola Triumph, the small thing only has a 1 Ghz Processor (an old one at that) and can only connect to "a" "b" and "g" networks. Despite that, it gets a solid 4 bars in the exact same place in my living room. And despite the fact that it only has a single core processor that clocks in at 1ghz (well really 1.3 now that I've rooted it, and no I have NOT rooted my Prime... there could potentially be a yet there) it has comparable speeds to my Transformer Prime at times. When we compare that to my Transformer Prime with a quad 1.6Ghz Tegra "beast" you can sort of see how come it can get a little frustrating. Now, let's be honest here, the Prime is usually loading full size sites in comparison to the bite sized mobile sites my Triumph usually loads, and it most definitely has faster speeds with all of the "important" things like Facebook, so I'll be honest here and say that speeds are if anything slightly faster, but the thing is they should be miles faster. In the words of Samsung, they should be another GALAXY faster... no?The other thing that doesn't work so perfect is the GPS, not always the best, and while I hate to bring up my Triumph again, although I can NOT tell you the exact details of how much better the GPS is, it's certainly better on the Triumph than the Prime...Let's wrap this up before I go write a book. So to finish, even after all that, I would most definitely still recommend the Transformer Prime, the specs are great, the display is beautiful, and the battery life is just incredible (no official tests, but maybe like 10-12 hrs off a charge). On top of that, it's thinner and lighter than an Ipad 2 (thereby making it thinner and lighter than an Ipad 3 as well) and has by far the most responsive touchscreen I've ever used. While most people are probably going to shy away from this product, because the 300 series is coming out for a slightly more affordable price, and Asus is eventually going to be releasing a 7 inch tablet with the same processor specs as this for $250 (rumor), I'd still highly recommend it. As this review mostly seems to focus on the negative, I'd suggest that you check out all of the amazing things that are on the Asus website, because just about every last one of them are true, as long as you can keep in mind that you just might have spotty wifi and bad GPS (although I don't really see the point of GPS on a tablet).

Content: Tablet review. I waited for the new Ipad 3 to come out and when it did not have anything new I decided to purchase a product that would do what I wanted.  This tablet is well built and meets my needs.  I needed some when I travel to play games watch movies an listen to music as well as do email and internet.  This tablet does all of that with no problems.  It has a great run time wonderful screen and camera to boot.  It flickers sometimes so wonder if something is not quite right but it has never had a problem other than that.  My only real complaint is more of my knowledge that I have more learning curve of operating and backing it up than I thought I would but I am sure I will overcome that.  It appears to work better with windows 7 than the machine I want to use that is windows XP.  Over all I can highly recommend this tablet.

Content: ASUS Tablet was the perfect choice. I bought this for work, and looked at all tablets (including iPads). First I set $500 as my cap, but moved it to $700 to include and compare more tablets and more options. Purchased this for $600 (I think it was $614 including tax, 2 day shipping, etc).I'm not a fan of smart phones. I use my phone (a lot) for business, but texts, calls, conference calls, GPS and camera are all I need and want in a phone, and my (non)smart phone does all those things better than most smart phones AND the battery lasts 10X longer than a smart phone. But my business sometimes requires me to have email access also when I'm out of the office. I'm 55, don't like wearing reading glasses, so I decided to get the largest, clearest, easiest smart phone I could get... and this tablet was it.It's awesome. The battery is great, lasts much longer than my partner's smart phone battery. The screen is large and clear. I can easily type on the touch screen with my fat fingers, etc. I've only had it a couple months but I do use it quite a bit and like it. I thought I'd resist it as much as I resist smartphones, but I don't. I use it and like it. Never hangs, easy to use, quick boot, large clear screen, light, thin.Great investment. I'd buy it again for sure.

Content: I'm A Believer! I am on month 3 using my Transformer T201. LOVE IT.  I recently traded in my old desktop for a Dell gaming notebook.  However, wanted something that was mobile, quad core, at least 32GB and under $500, with bluetooth, HDMI. After researching various pads, decided on this model.  LOVE IT.  This model has it all. I haven't purchased the docking station, as this would defeat the purpose for me, but if it were my only internet connection, definitely would.  Incredibly easy to "set up" and navigate, etc.  I haven't run into any problems, other than once in a while it will hang, but good tradeoff for the other features while ICS is being fully developed. Buy one and HAVE FUN!

Content: Transformer Prime : best  product i bought on amazon. I bought the transformer prime on Amazon US because it was out of stock every where in UK. The seller was very good the parcel was delivered on time and in mint condition. I have the table for almost 5 months now and i never had any issue what so ever. people have complained about the WiFi and GPS but I have never experience such issue , my transformer picks up the signal pretty well , sometime even better than my Nexus S.This little thing has saved my life several time, it possibility to act as net book(Very portable and fast net book) make this tablet an life changer and although people argue that it pricey, i would say that it worth spending some cash on it . It is solid, the screen is scratch resistant thanks to it gorilla glass and the metallic body make it look very posh and yet durable. Also, ASUS is very good at assisting their customer so far they have been pushing updates very often and fast and I believe it will be even better now that they have sign partnership with Google.The prime is a powerful entertainment gadget, sometime it beats my PS3 as it plays 1080p MKV file very smoothly. Hook it up to the receiver for the best High Def experience. However I have noticed that the sound output while using the HDMI cable is some how mono or only stereo. I hope ASUS or Google find the way around it.The prime came with loads of cool app. My favourite one is MyCloud, which let you control your home pc from where ever you are as if your table was running Windows. All touch gesture are supported (unlike other like Teamviewer)the experience is amazing . one day I went to a party and they didn't have music, thanks to the Prime and the Mycloud app, I was actually playing the music from my home PC but the sound was output on the Prime miles away from home.This is just a little overview of what the Prime has bought to my life... Really ... I am in looove with it

Content: Poor cable connection design, worse customer service NOT RECOMMENDED. August Update:After several weeks I received my 'repaired' tablet.  The cable connection now appears solid.  I've 'owned' the tablet since March, but as the first one was exchanged due to the cable connection and the second one had to be sent in for repair within a month of reciept, it's only been in my hands for about 2 months.Now it seems to be operating OK, expectthe poor GPS reception.  Asus never informed me that for a while they were providing 'free' external adapters for them; but only through July 31st apparently.Also, it seems I cannot charge using the USB cable excpet when it is plugged into the Asus 120V adapter; the tablet won't charge from my PC or laptop USB ports or any other 120V/USB adapter I own.I think now it is a decent tablet, but expect better at the price point.  I much prefer the Motoroal Xoom I had and gave to my wife when I bought the Asus (heck, my old Archos 10.1 was more reliable and easy to operate).  Customer service is very poor; though someone from Asus that read my original review anmd contacted me within 48-hours, a much better response time that their customer service (more interested in their imgae than their performance?).ORIGINAL REVIEW.I have owned dozens of portable electronic devices over the years, as well as many PCs.  I have never experienced anything like the problem of the proprietary cable that comes with this tablet.  The first one I bought in March worked for about a month before the metal pins inside the tablet (the 'male' portion of the plug system) became bent, rendering the connection useless; I was unable to charge the tablet.  Amazon replaced that one.  My new puppy dmamaged the cable on the new tablet, though it was still able to charge the tablet; so I ordered 2 OEM cables through Amazon; the first time I plugged one in it bent the pins on the male side of the plug.  Again, not able to charge the tablet.Amazon Cusomer service gave me a link to an Asus "Live Chat" site.  For almost two weeks I have visited the site at least daily; the site has either been closed or no Eee pad support personnel are available.I have never expereinced a similar issues with all the other cables, tablets, media players, etc.  I've used many types of cables(everything from ribbon, to parallet, to USB, firewire and lots of proprietary cables) and plugged and unplugged devices countless times without any problems.Asus customer service doesn't seem to exist.

Content: Good Tablet but Apparently defective Unit !! I received the Transformer Prime last week , the packaging was really good no issues with that.Pros:1) The tablet is well built, looks really nice.2) Touch on the screen is responsive, nice android icecream sandwich platform. Easy to use.Cons:1)Bad wifi connectivity, after I charged the tablet as instructed in the manual, I turned on the tablet and it couldn't connect to wifi, it kept saying turning wifi on but it never did, I had to search for the reset to factory settings options to reset the tablet, after that it did connect, which is not supposed to happen, I shouldn't need to reset a brand new tablet for the wifi to work.After that it only gave 3 out of 4 bars and I have a very strong internet connection at home, I live in a small apartment and the router is about 10 feet away not in the basement or anything, videos took time to buffer which doesn't happen with my other mobile devices.2) I mainly got this tablet for it's flash support. All the websites I use to watch movies and TV Shows doesn't show on this tablet 90% of the time, sometimes I get the movie to show it's first picture but then it doesn't load.I am returning this tablet and hopefully amazon will refund for both the tablet and the keyboard accessory cause I don't need the keyboard anymore.This tablet appear to be really good, but apparently I got a defective one.

Content: Great Tablet. Great device.  It is fast, responsive, great on battery life, and feels great in your hands.  Sure it may have issues with GPS, but that is a minor fault.  WiFi is pretty good, just a bit below perfect since it is only 2.4MHz and not 5.0Mhz.  It is still very quick and the graphics are very fast for games.  Also, it charges super quick.  Probably in half the time of an iPad and with similar battery life.

Content: Great Tablet, Minor problem. Great Tablet, and it works fine for the most part. When I received it in the mail, the charging port was bent, but still useable. In addition,  it has the problem of randomly restarting/rebooting. It can lock up randomly while under normal use, and then after sitting for a few seconds it has a little box pop up that informs you that the program has stopped responding and would I like to wait or close it.Usually, when the little box pops up, it starts working again. Not a deal breaker by any means, but still an annoyance. Overall though, the experience has been a good one, and I would definitely purchase it again, if I had it to do over.

Content: An overrated device. If you're trying to decide on buying a tablet please avoid this one. Camera is problemtic, and support for it is poor. I can't begin to narrate my experience. GPS that was marketed as a great feature never works. The charger stopped working. The charging port is wearing. Please stick with tested and trusted product this one is a failure. I regret paying a premium for it.

Content: Not worth the money. I've had my prime for several years. Had I know what a nightmare their customer services is, I would never have bought the unit. The camera died and it took two months to get this thing back only after contacting their HQ in Taiwan. The customer support line people are reading scripts like little robots and are not allowed to contact the people who actually fix the units directly. They also make you pay for shipping.Also, the cheap plastic on the USB cable literally fell off and they refused to replace it. Had this been Apple customer services, they would have replaced it and given me a $20 for iTunes.Wireless performance is very poor, GPS ended up in Asus loosing a class action lawsuit and scrolling is very jerky. Overall, a catastrophic and expensive customer experience.

Content: Amazingly powerful and pretty little thing! I pre-ordered the Prime on November 1st (from a different site since Amazon stopped taking orders) and thank goodness I did!  I received it on Dec. 28th and see the price has already gone up.  Nuts.  Anyway, I had ordered the silver but got a call saying I would be receiving the champagne unless I wanted to wait longer.  I was pleasantly surprised at the color...almost more like a pewter than champagne.  I am not a techie person and only capable of giving an average user's review of this device.  It's super fast and the graphics are ridiculous.  I've never been a "gamer" person but I can't stop playing this jet ski game.  It's amazing, words can not explain.  Water splashes up and it really looks like water is splashing on the screen.  Camera takes decent pictures but I have an SLR that will always trump any other camera.  It seems to have it all.  I have a lot to learn and actually use with this tablet but so far I have no complaints.  But for amateurs like me just know...the "user manual" that comes with it is nothing more than directions on how to plug it in and turn it on.  The rest you will have to figure out.  Also, I was a little surprised to see that when I went to buy a game the credit card number used to purchase the tablet was already programmed in there.  One click and boom.  Game bought.  Convenient? Yes.  A little too convenient for a 4 yr old to easily purchase whatever game he feels like playing at the time? Yes. Surely there is some way to password protect this...but I haven't figured it out (no user manual =)I can't wait to get the docking station and wish they had been released together.  But at the end of the day, I'm happy and would recommend this device to anyone considering an ipad, etc. as I think the android system is more diverse than anything else on the market.  Now if I could get my son to understand that Santa brought this for me and not him I might have more to review =)

Content: Not bad, but not great. Pros-Quick and snappy; moves between applications fluidly without much pause-Camera takes surprisingly good photographs-Light weight-Sturdy build-Aesthetically I think it looks great-The touch screen seems fairly scratch resistant, though I can't say it has been in contact with anything that would potentially damage it-Display looks greatCons-Most significantly, to me, the precision of the touch screen is relatively low.  It works fine for selecting apps or navigation, but is a struggle for precise activities such as taking notes or drawing with a stylus-Wifi seems a little weak-Spun aluminum back is very easy to scratch-The display picks up smudges or fingerprints frequentlyI have also noticed some problems running embedded flash videos, but I assume this is an Android problem and not an Asus one.

Content: Good Tablet, But Flawed. I owned the original Asus Transformer and was very happy with it. After reading all the glowing articles and reviews on those tech websites about the new Prime, I was left drooling and had to have it. I had also read some of the negative comments from people that began receiving their orders and were experiencing some issues. So, I was excited, but also somewhat apprehensive. After waiting anxiously for several weeks, I finally received my Prime on 1/6. I spent the next several days puting it through its paces. I knew there were issues with the GPS, which I was able to confirm. It was a disappointment, but not a deal breaker for me. I also experienced issues with weak Wifi and Bluetooth reception. Although I never lost wifi connectivity within the house, it was pretty weak in certain areas of the house especially my backyard, which I never experienced with my other Transformer or laptops. I could definitely see the weak wifi being a problem at public locations, such as hotels and airports. Besides the GPS, Wifi and BT issues, I noticed the tablet was considerably slow while browsing. It was almost painful - to the point that on one occasion, I put it down and used my old laptop to finish what I was doing.On 1/9, I was pleasantly surprised that the ICS upgrade was made available. After installing it, I noticed the Prime seemed to come to life. Apps and especially the stock browser worked much faster. However, I soon experienced other problems including the email client and browser requiring a force close every other time. I also noticed flashing anomalies on the home screen - sections of the screen would flash and go dark.I loved everything else about the Prime. The thin, light form factor, the brilliant IPS screen, Tegra 3 optimized games. So, it was with a heavy heart that I drove to Best Buy this afternoon to return it. If Asus can fix the issues on the Prime, I would consider purchasing it again. But, it doesn't look like that will be the case since they will be releasing the 700 series instead.

Content: amazing productivity. I have had my Prime for a week now. I have tested just about every aspect of use that would be usable for my needs.WiFi/Bluetooth/video playback/PDF reading/battery life/Web Surfing*WiFi I have had no issues for connecting with anything. I'm not to particularly needy with my signal strength so i have not really been to anal about the strength but if I can send a wireless print job to a machine over 300 ft away its all good, connecting to customer's WiFi signals, Hospital WiFi and anything that my iPod Touch picks up my Transformer Prime will pick up.*Bluetooth I have been syncing any device or phone to send mp3's, and video left and right*Video Playback, I run many point of sale booths for concessions at local events. Using this for video has been very good for the one event used so far. I have downloaded 1080p resolution videos and this tablet has yet to hiccup.*PDF reading, I know this would be a standard for many thing that has adobe acrobat but It is important for me like tonight When I sat down with a few doctors that wanted documented proof of product information, so i just used Polaris office to bring up the information. I'm also using this as a replacement for Service manual, Service documentation, Part breakdowns for any equipment that I would normally need a laptop to look up or an internet connection.*battery life, I pull my transformer Prime off of the charger at about 7:30am and i usually get home about 5pm. that's about 9-1/2 I'm usually at about 45% to 30% battery life after using it for the above uses*Web Surfing, when ever I go to a customer site I connect to the internet and log in and out for work, check my companies dispatch screens to look for what i am to do for the day. I also use it for connecting through a VPN to look at inventory for parts and pricing Inquiries. and to check on company vehicle GPS to look for other local technicians to assist if need be. I have used the installed browser and added Firefox, i have to say that using Firefox seems to be faster for certain sites and ASUS's browser seems to be better for others. its all where i need to go to know what browser to use.I have noticed a problem with the screen glitching when i have a lot of programs running, but closing this out ends that.I have yet to see any real problems with any hardware or software.btw if you are looking for a game get RIPTIDE!!!

Content: GPS dead on arrival. The tablet is great except for one thing- the GPS is completely dead. I was not expecting miracles for the GPS, as many people have noticed poor signal strength with this due to the aluminum case, but I cannot get ANY signal at all. It is as if the GPS chip is completely missing or non-functional. I will likely be returning this.

Content: ASUS Fails. I'm sure the tablet might have been very good if it actually worked correctly.  I preordered my tablet originally on November 22.  I received my tablet from Amazon on January 4th, and found out that the gyroscope and accelerometer didn't work at all.  I called up ASUS, and after a few calls back and forth, they decided that it was indeed broken, and that I had to send it in.  It sucked, but they told me that it would take 7 days to fix once they received it, so I said alright, two weeks at most with shipping time, I can do that.  I sent the tablet back and it arrived at ASUS on January 9th according to USPS tracking.  ASUS's RMA status page didn't say that they had received it, until a week later on the 16th.  When I called on the 16th, they assured me that it would be fixed and sent out on the 17th or 18th (7 business days).  The 18th came and went, and the status on the tablet on ASUS's site changed to "Waiting-[WB5] Wait for Repair\Test\Aging."  It's still at that status today.  Calling support doesn't help at all.  I've called multiple times, and they can't give me any status other than it's still being repaired, that they'll elevate it, and let me know in 3 days.  It's going on 3 weeks now, and ASUS still hasn't given me any meaningful update or eta on when I can get the tablet back.  I have friends who didn't even pre-order the tablet who have it now in working order.  Now I'm worried that if I ever do get the tablet back, that the wifi will be gimped on it.  In hindsight, I probably should have just sent it back to Amazon for a refund.I've bought plenty of ASUS products before, mainly motherboards.  No more, their support and RMA process is absolutely terrible.  I don't want to have to go through this again.  Is it too much to ask to give an accurate status or eta to an RMA?  You can do much better ASUS.

Content: AWESOME Tablet. Approaching this review from the tablet/OS perspective, NOT downloaded apps, between an iPad2 and this Transformer Prime. While I feel like the apps are really what make a tablet worth while, there are too many differences between the same app on both devices that come down to quality of programming spend for the device. Being honest, most developers spend more time/money on the iPad version, then attempt a conversion to Android.I only got to play with the Honeycomb version of this tablet for about 4 days, and it felt very similar to an iPad2: transitions between desktop screens flickered, WiFi worked ok with issues connecting to places like Chic-Fil-A, GPS so slow to connect outdoors but then worked great (not so great indoors). Main drawback to the Prime/Honeycomb tablet was it was constantly referred as a "phone". Prompts about making calls, ringtones, vibrate feature etc. It really took away from the tablet only (no 3G/4G available). There WAS no reason to accept this tablet over the iPad2...All this changed with the update to Icecream Sandwich (ICS), transitions between desktop screens is SMOOTH, better than iPad2. WiFi update stablized the issues connecting at Chic-Fil-A, GPS connection improved with an update. All these updates to the system were out within the first MONTH of product release.Now for my tidbit on the app areas: Apple has better apps and more of them, no surprise being the leader. Once you select iPad your into the WHOLE Apple bandwagon with iTunes and iCloud. Now their products just work very well together which is very appealing if you like all their products. Android Marketplace has a lot of great apps, most the same as their iTunes conterpart, however "some" are more finicky on Android than iOS. However, the best app reason for Android the ability to install apps from other sources, like Amazon or GetJar. This allows you to bypass Google if desired and pick your own sources for apps.I am in no way an expert and this only represents my opinion. Only trying it for yourself can you build an accurate picture.

Content: Awesome love the tablet!!! So like almost anyone & everyone i have been keeping a close eye since this tablet was announced & all i can say is wow this tablet is amazing!!I ordered the tablet when i saw Amazon had it in stock for $499, so i couldn't resist & placed the order. This is my 3rd tablet, my first was a XOOM then the iPad 2 & i have to say i am blown away by what ASUS did here. I was a little skeptical at first with all the negative reviews but then decided to take my chance seeing how Amazon has a good return system in place & boy was i not disappointed!The 1st thing when u get the tablet u will notice is how drop-dead sexy the tablet is! Its a solid build & the screen is just amazing!The WiFi is a little weak but i have yet to have any problem that really makes me regret the buy. Yes the WiFi is a weak sometimes, but honestly i never had a problem web surfing or doing any other online activities. I use my phones GPS more then my tablet so it doesn't bother me as much but with the WiFi the GPS isn't all bad.This tablet has impressed me in every way & exceeded my expectations in a lot of ways! The tablet is built like a beast! Its just buttery smooth & the only time i had problems was when i was trying to run 3 games at the same time & the marketplace & web browsing ...& even then the tablet was running smooth given u gave it a few seconds to cope.I have to say I am impressed by ASUS with the build quality! I have had multiple people ask me what it is & if they can play with it.I would definitely recommend it to anyone as long as u buy from Amazon with an awesome return & exchange policy! ..just in case anything goes wrong

Content: Has a few bugs. Waited forever to get my new Asus Transformer Prime, but what a disappointment. Didn't have any wi-fi issues like some reviewers have, but did have some other problems. For starters the tablet would power off for no reason every 20-30 minutes. Secondly, it was not a big issue but the weather widget didn't work. I called Asus tech support and they had me do fresh re-boot but this didn't solve the issues. Sending it back tomorrow. Plus I didn't like the fingerprint magnet screen. Don't waste your money.

Content: This is OK, But... the WiFi performance is very bad. I received this three days ago. I have to say that I like the look and feel of it, the screen is excellent and the general operating performance is very good. I particularly like the finely fluted back plate as this allows grip, which the smooth back of the IPADs do not provide.The only issue I have with it is the WiFi performance which is appalling. In order to be able to reliably connect, I have to be sat almost on top of the node. I have noted the various forums which say that you need to press the top of the screen or flex the tablet slightly to improve performance, which does actually work. But is this the way to go? That you have to deform the tablet in order to get relaiable WiFi performance!Considering the main purpose of a tablet is portability, I would have expected that the WiFi performance would be a priority during product design and testing. This seems to not be the case.On this alone, considering the nature of the item I would not reccomend purchase until ASUS sort this out, and how they will correct it retrospectively will be interesting to see. Thats if they do correct it. There seems to be little evidence of any move to do so to date.

Content: Reviewing This Again 8 Months Later. Initially, I really loved this tablet. It was fast and ran everything as smooth as silk. After a while, things began going downhill gradually, and the love affair basically ended. The wifi speed was always slow, but it eventually began to gnaw at me how terrible this thing was when I really needed it. Updates from Asus became few and far between and after releasing the new version of this tablet just a short couple of months later they abandoned this and everyone who had initially defended this device in the beginning. I was able to salvage a bit of usability by installing a custom ROM, but just recently the camera has stopped working, which is apparently just par for the course for the Transformer Prime. What could have been an amazing piece of technology seems more like an attempt to grab as much cash as possible on something they knew to be faulty and cut their losses in the end. I still love Android, but I can safely say I wouldn't buy another Asus product in the future to save my life. Stick with Samsung or some of the other manufacturers who know how to make hardware.

Content: The Best to date. If you ride the "i" band wagon then there is not much I will probably be able to tell you. If not then it is simple, this is the best tablet available right now.As with many people out there I have read the reviews and yes you can get a bad tablet that is DOA, or WIFI picky, or has GPS issues. I am not one of them and it should not take a person long to figure it out and exchange it if it happens to you. This is why businesses have return policies. I have a MS in EE and work in the electronics industry and let me tell you lemons happen, don't get bent.The image from the screen is excellent, better than my Galaxy 10.1. Games look great and so do movies, I have not seen it's equal. The 8MP camera for a tablet is very good (video or pics). However, it will not be replacing my HD camcorder or SLR. I have had no wireless issues or GPS issues in a 2-story home or a 3 story office. I have been finding apps just fine and have had no issue running any of them. The touch is great and easy to use, no fat finger issues or lag. The dock option makes it better yet. Longer battery life with the dock (about double). The mouse pad and pointer work as good as you ever would expect. With the dock I forget I am using a tablet.My wife, mother-in-law, and kids have all enjoyed using it. I have also used it at work with no issues.Matter of fact I have never had an issue of any kind.

Content: Best Android Tablet to date. I have used my fair share of tablets (Android, iPads, Playbook) and though I doubt that the Asus Transformer Prime (ATP) will win over many of the Apple lovers, I have to say that this is without  doubt the best tablet I have ever used. The ATP is sleek, slim and sturdy. The materials used to build it give it the quality feel you would expect in a device of this price range. The performance is second to none. The battery life is better than advertised and the GPS is functional if not phenomenal. I have not had any of the wifi issues reported, but I did do the squeeze trick before turning it on the first time so that may be part of the reason. ICS is far smoother on the ATP than it is on any other Android tablet. Once connected to the keyboard dock this awesome tablet becomes a great netbook with even better battery life. If you're in the market for a tablet this one is at least one worth looking at, but if you know you want an Android the ATP is the one to buy. I have not been so happy with a purchase in a while.

Content: Asus transformer prime - Poor WiFi and GPS. Having been convinced by the stellar specs of this tablet, I decided to buy one for home use.  I ordered the device through amazon and it was delivered within one day with free shipping (nicely done Amazon)!!!  When I started using the device I started noticing minor problems with WiFi connectivity and connection speeds.  When I was next to my wireless router, the connections were good as expected (16Mbps give or take).  When I moved one room away in the house I would get a speed of about 8Mbps.  When I moved even further away in my house the speeds would plunge down to about 300Kbps.  Just for comparison, my smart phone and laptop don't suffer these slowdowns while connected to my Wireless N router anywhere in the house. I was hoping that some software updates promised from ASUS would fix this unacceptable WiFi behavior within my product return window but alas this did not to happen.  When I started using some applications which make use of GPS, I noticed how badly the GPS data reception was on this device.  When outside I could weakly detect several satilites after waiting many minutes.  And even after all of this time it was unable to get better positioning accuracy than about 75ft.  This was evident when using google maps with GPS enabled - The map was centered over my neighbors house across the street.  No updates that ASUS furnished resolved this problem.  These were the problems that finally drove me to return the device since it is unsuitable for my use.I should also mention that the rest of the tablet features (32GB storage,microSD,keyboard dock,CPU/GPU performance) were really great. Too bad the the WiFi and GPS were nearly unusable.  I am quite disappointed with ASUS for releasing a product like this.

Content: The best tablet available at this time. Period! Pre-ordered this late last year while owning the original Transformer with dock. Have now had this long enough to go through all of the paces including the dock (of which I went through 3 to find a perfect one).Originally I was going to purchase an iPad2 like so many others that cannot get past the Starbucks fascination of owning an Apple product. My primary concern with Apple products including my iPhone was the lack of real memory with Apple limiting any expansion in their products-though great otherwise. As I recently converted both of my phones over to Android phones, that pretty much clinched the purchase as purchasing and juggling two platforms made little sense. I did go at it slow originally as I wanted to ensure that the tools (apps) I require were both available and worked well on the Android system vs Apple. Now only were they available, even better options were to be found which was a pleasant surprise as a lot of junk apps are also on the Android Market.Now to the tablet:Breaking this down into simple terms:Pros:.Very fast. With quad core and an extra chip to handle video, this tablet is speed with ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich). With exception to browsing (Dolphin HD) which is just OK. Try out Opera..Battery life:  An honest 9 hrs+ with just tablet and over 17 hrs with the dock. Even while watching movies the battery drains very slowly. Very impressive. Also, the dock charges the tablet when connected..Styling. Extremely nice and modern style. All aluminum (which is also it's greatest sin). This tablet is hot looking. I have tghe champagne version which is more like a light metallic bronze..Expandability: Micro HDMI, USB (dock), miniSD. I have a 128gb microSD card for a total of 192gb in the tablet alone and a 64gb in the dock for a total of 256gb. I have a large amount of HD movies, games, photos, apps, etc. All play very well from the cards with no hiccups of any sort. Native USB mouse support and native PS3 controller support via USB. Just plug and go, no ROM needed. Also, the mentioned dock is an exceptional accessory. It adds battery life, USB, looks great, fits well , and really does complete the package..Video playback. Another win over iPhone is the ability to play a wide array of movie formats which Apple can be stubborn about. Playback is very smooth, bright, and you can easily scroll forward or back with no delay or crashes. Very impressive..Graphics:  Superb, the best available on a tablet at the moment. Just youtube comparisons of Shadowgun and Riptide vs. the iPad2 and you will see the dramatic improvements over the iPad and original Transformer..WIFI:  LOL.  Many complain about the WIFI as the aluminum backing does inhibit the signal. However my particular model has great WIFI and downloads faster than any tablet prior. No issues at all here. Additionally, I Hotspot off of my 4G Android phones, again no issues. No fee either through my carrier..Screen: Large 10.1" screen with Gorilla Glass and highest tablet resolution at the moment. Very strong, very bright IPS, even outdoors. Movies and games look great along with spreadsheets.CONS.Lack of accessories such as cases with the tablet/dock (current versions are designed incorrectly resulting in too thick of material between dock and tablet hinge.) Ton of stuff available for iPads and the original Transformer (those will not fit the Prime).GPS. Yep, I do not use it on a tablet, but it is advertised (before), and the signal is blocked by that gorgeous aluminum backing. Simply does not work on mine. EDIT: Recent firmwares have improved this and it does now lock onto over 12 satellites though still not great for driving.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Recent airplane trip. Edited a few spreadsheets, tired of that, decided to watch a full length HD movie, then connect my PS3 controller and played Shadowgun. The guy sitting next to me and another across from the aisle were blown away with this tablet sparking plenty of conversation. It is an impressive piece which has a tendency to draw people into your business. Expect it unless your doing something boring. Using it in the AM, then at the terminal, on the flight, I still had over 80% of total battery left. I did not even bother taking out my laptop.Overall with dock and memory cards (2) it was a bit expensive, however at the end of the day, well worth it IMO..

Content: biggest potential in the device just need patience until the right one come. UPDATE 10 JUNE - 2012on march as soon as i've asked for a replace, amazon send me new tblet as soon as they get them in stock, this new one change my first rate from 1 star to 5, this is what i asked for, a real tablet with no bugs or things like that, it works flawesly, no more hdmi problems, browser works great, no more gyroscope issues or sensors working randomly, right now this baby is a huge mate, i carry this prime with me everywhere, i've use this tablet for 2 days as music player without connect to a energy source, as AC charger uses a pin/usb conector, i buyd a female/female usb adapter to conect my gamepad, wifi gate is not an issue right now and ive received 1 gps extension from asus directly so if yu dock it, you can navigate in your country without any internet needUPDATE MARCH - 2012------------------------------------------i've use the hdmi connector to use my prime on a TV and guess what, most games doesn't work properly, most of them fails to open when hdmi cable is connected, it's scarry, even movies stop working when connected to a TV, i've decided and asked amazon to a replace (would like to buy a new ipad but right now i'm with a keyboar dock station, and cover sleeve and leather case, if my new prime has some autorotate or sensors problem i definitely shoot myself------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW FEB - 2012I've been following detailed the launch of different tablets since motorola xoom on january\2010 until now, and when the prime was announced i fell in love and after 1 week of working with it i must say that i love it and i hate it, why? The overall is awesome, it's 110% fluid, no lag, perfect multitask, screen quality awesome but i hate it for just one simple reason (forget wifi and gps issue cuz this one is most important)Transformer prime has a critical issue, sensors works randomly so you wont have gyroscope, light sensor, proximity sensor, compass, gravity, orientation etc.  My asus right out of the box had this issue, when i take it that day tried to play Riptide GP and guess what, never recognize  movement with gyroscope, i have tried with hard reset, wipe and a lot of stuff and realized that in transformer forum (ths big one) there's lot of people with same problem and all of them had called to asus support with no success, others have receive a warranty replacement with no luck cuz new device has also same issue and the only solution right now is reboot device lot of times until you get sensos working properly (just for a little time then it stops working again)

Content: Really Love It. I have had my Asus Transformer Prime for about a month, and love it so far. I bought a SanDisk 32Gb mini SDHC card to give me 64GB total, and also purchased the TF 201 Mobile Docking Station, which is really helpful when you have to do a lot of typing, plus it gives you the view of the entire 10" screen instead of losing half of it for the virtual keyboard. I have downloaded tons of books through the Kindle, and Olivetree apps, that work very well. I bought my wife an Apple IPad 32GB Tablet for Christmas, so I have been able to play with both, and I like my Asus the best. However, there are two things that her IPad does better:1)more apps, which doesn't bother me because I have been able to find everthing that I need in the Android market, the one app that I am waiting for (WordsearchBible 10) is suppose to be available by the summer).2)the Ipad speaker blows the Asus speaker away-- again this is no biggie for me. The Asus speaker is adequate and I bought the Altec Lansing Orbit mini speaker that plugs into the headphone jack and delivers unbelievable sound-- great for traveling. That said, I still prefer the Asus Prime, with a mini sd slot and more flexibility than the more proprietary Apple. The full size keyboard and USB slot of the docking station, which also has an eight hour battery (in addition to the battery in the tablet itself). And the Asus Transformer Prime has the first quad core processor.I highly reccomend this tablet.

Content: Awesome "Prime" The name says enough. After having owned the Galaxy Tab 10.1" and the 7" From Samsung.And spending hours exploring the other Android tablets available and an Ipad both in reviews and hands on.The Asus Transformer Prime With Android 4.03 is appropiately named, Transformer "Prime" ,as in Prime rib = Prime tablet.The speed difference alone in the Prime compared to others available is evident in everyday use of app launching or something as simple in keyboard response  (NO Lag)The Samsung galaxy Tabs offer a pleasant screen, which is one of the main reasons for purchasing my first Galaxy Tab.But I can honestly say the Asus Tf201 Transformer Prime Display is Beautiful.My 25" hd HP monitor doesnt display blacks or contrast with the  readability of the PrimeIf you are considering an Android Tablet I can highly recommend The AsusAnd for anyone Not familiar with the ASUS name "Asus" has been building computer motherboards along with other major components for over 25 years.I have owned my Transformer Prime for about a month.

Content: Great Alternative for iPad. The Asus Transformer Prime is a great alternative to any iPad. It's fast, it plays flash and apps are available - more than you could ever need. Besides, you can add more space by adding MicroSDHC chips of up to 64 GB each - I did not try the 128 GB version yet (up to two extra chips with the extra keyboard). So memory can be up to 196 GB. There is a USB connection on the keyboard, and on the screen itself a Micro-HDMI connection.. All these you don't have on an iPad.. It misses an internet connection "on the road" -  but my iPad had very bad connections anyhow (I live in West LA).

Content: Awesome tablet. I just received my transformer prime and so far, I absolutely love it.  I'm about 4 days in and haven't had any problems. I was originally hesitant due to the reviews on GPS and wifi issues that many others have brought up.  So far, at home, at work, and at school, I haven't had a single connectivity problem. I'm assuming Asus addressed this issue. I haven't used the GPS yet nor do I anticipate ever using it.  Driving with a 10" tablet in front of you doesn't seem like the best idea to me. Anyways, the update to ICS was seamless and I haven't had any crashes yet.  The screen is beautiful and the processor is faster than any other touch device I've used to date.  The screen is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but that's a non issue for me. 5 stars. I love it.

Content: Look elsewhere. Since I got this tablet I have had slow internet that would stop and close quite often for no reason.  It will not display aspx/form pages well at all.  I, like a fool, bought the keyboard and like many others around the world have a cracked glass because of it.  I returned to ASUS and was confronted with a $250 repair bill.  It's a nice toy but not worth the $700 I paid and now $250 to fix.  If you do get this tablet, DO NOT GET THE KEYBOARD.  Plus the added bonus if you buy from Amazon you cannot get an aftermarket warranty.  Just more of the same from ASUS.

Content: Great Product, Terrible Support, Not Worth the Wait. I waited more than a month to get my TF201 and keyboard.  They arrived and were all that I'd hoped they would be for ~1 month until I tried to dock the tablet to the keyboard today and it wouldn't go all of the way down into the keyboard. Closer examination revealed that one of the screws had come out of the keyboard and was rattling around loose in the clam shell.I figured that I would just pull the clamshell apart and put the screw back in with some of the blue lock tight as that looked like what the factory had done (admittedly not well given that it had come out on me) initially. I got looking at the tablet though, and there must have been a period of time where the screw was loose and rubbing up against the gorilla glass because I've got a circular scratch in the glass.It's a minor point, but my view is that the problem is completely the fault of ASUS.  It's a combination of the keyboard being improperly assembled, and a design that could have been better. Hindsight is 20/20, but they probably should have put a plastic facing over the screws so the if one came up like that it would push the plastic into the channel and stop the tablet from getting down far enough to get scratched up.ASUS support was spectacularly disappointing. I use my Prime every day as a laptop replacement and will be traveling over the next little while, so I asked them to ship me out another tablet and keyboard so that I could continue working, and I'd ship them my original as soon as I had the replacement model.The rep said that they wouldn't do anything because the tablet hadn't been functionally impacted. I pointed out that the docking station at this point had been functionally compromised, and said that while the tablet hadn't been functionally compromised, the glass had been scratched up through an error on the part of the factory in the assembly of the keyboard.He said that they wouldn't do any kind of hot swap to allow me to continue to work with my Prime, but that he could arrange for a shipment of my gear back to a repair center where it could be evaluated, but 'if the damage was judged to be user error' that the warranty wouldn't cover it.I told him I didn't think that was reasonable, but that I can't go without my Prime for the time required to ship it back and forth, so I'd just fix the keyboard myself as I originally intended, and then I'd leave a negative review around the quality of their support and the poor build quality on the keyboard.Pretty disappointed all in all with the overall experience.

Content: Transformer Prime : best  product i bought on amazon. I bought the transformer prime on Amazon US because it was out of stock every where in UK. The seller was very good the parcel was delivered on time and in mint condition. I have the table for almost 5 months now and i never had any issue what so ever. people have complained about the WiFi and GPS but I have never experience such issue , my transformer picks up the signal pretty well , sometime even better than my Nexus S.This little thing has saved my life several time, it possibility to act as net book(Very portable and fast net book) make this tablet an life changer and although people argue that it pricey, i would say that it worth spending some cash on it . It is solid, the screen is scratch resistant thanks to it gorilla glass and the metallic body make it look very posh and yet durable. Also, ASUS is very good at assisting their customer so far they have been pushing updates very often and fast and I believe it will be even better now that they have sign partnership with Google.The prime is a powerful entertainment gadget, sometime it beats my PS3 as it plays 1080p MKV file very smoothly. Hook it up to the receiver for the best High Def experience. However I have noticed that the sound output while using the HDMI cable is some how mono or only stereo. I hope ASUS or Google find the way around it.The prime came with loads of cool app. My favourite one is MyCloud, which let you control your home pc from where ever you are as if your table was running Windows. All touch gesture are supported (unlike other like Teamviewer)the experience is amazing . one day I went to a party and they didn't have music, thanks to the Prime and the Mycloud app, I was actually playing the music from my home PC but the sound was output on the Prime miles away from home.This is just a little overview of what the Prime has bought to my life... Really ... I am in looove with it

Content: iPad Killer My Butt... I'll be short and sweet as there are MANY very informative reviews here. I bought my Asus back in January when it was touted as the best of the best and the only iPad killing tablet out there. Well not only has the camera NOT been working since I bought the tablet, but the extremely slow wifi speeds absolutely frustrate me. Unless I am within 10-12 feet of my router (this includes sitting in the basement right near it, or sitting in my living room which is located directly above where the router is located in the basement) the signal is little to nothing. I need to be right next to the router in order to have all the signal bars full...at 10 feet away I already drop one bar.  In 95% of my house I'm lucky if I get one signal bar which means extremely slow connection. My daughter's first generation iPad blows my Asus away when doing anything wifi related. The performance of the rest of the tablet is very good but because the wifi is so absolutely terrible I can't EVER recommend this tablet. What a waste of my time and money.As for the camera.. it has never worked. I have never called tech support so perhaps it could be fixed, but I don't need a camera on my tablet so it's no big deal for me. I do wonder whenever I get a software update if it will fix the problem, but they haven't yet. Maybe one of these days I'll call them up and see if there's something we can do to get it fixed.

Content: Wish speakers were louder. I've had the tablet for 6 months now.  I wish the speakers were louder.  At the highest volume, you can comfortably hear it if it's really quite.  If there's much noise going on, forget about it.  I don't think I would be able to hear it at an airport or coffee shop.  My cell phone (Samsung Galaxy) is much louder than the TF201.  My other complaint is wireless reception.  Going about 15 feet away from the router may give 1 bar, but most of the time no connection.  The iPad 2 is like this as well so I don't really think about the wireless anymore.  Maybe it's because of my under $100 router.Other than those 2 things, I love my TF201.  I use it for online browsing, game apps, spreadsheets.  I also have the keyboard dock and use it with the tablet 95% of the time.  My boyfriend has taken over my tablet and has considered it his now.  If I buy another tablet, I would buy an ASUS one again.

Content: Bested by the Infinity and little else. I've never been one to confine myself to a closed ecosystem, so Kindle Fire, Nook, iPad, etc... aren't my cup of tea.  I cannot fairly compare this to them, but if Android is for you, only the Nexus series can possibly beat this, and honestly, they fall short too.While the Transformer series offers a lot of features, you only need to appreciate a few of them to fall in love.  For me the biggies are:* Absolutely amazing screen: 720p, uber bright, great colors, and excellent viewing angles* 32GB onboard (I use every cloud offering, and 16GB just isn't enough)* up to 64GB in microSD capability (why have a HD tablet without room for HD media?) --note the card is flush when inserted* Jelly Bean!  You'll have a couple OTA updates to get you there, but it's there* vanilla android!* great design, which is kinda sexyOther features you may appreciate:* dock that adds keyboard, full SD, USB, and battery* compatibility with many Transformer Infinity accessoriesA couple minuses (not huge, but still there):* battery life could be better (though tweaks can help)* no 5ghz networking (kinda a bummer in a 2012 flagship device)* spotty GPS and imperfect (though functional) WiFi due to all aluminum casing* speaker is crap.  I just don't get HD video and not even bothering with stereo audio.* proprietary dock connector and 12v chargingSo what does this mean?  Well it's a great tablet.  I'll try the dock soon, but it's really just the icing on the cake if you're into that ability.  It's a great tablet based purely on it's screen and vanilla Android Jelly Bean.  The ASUS TF700T-B1-GR 10.1-Inch Tablet (Gray) is better, as it has fixed the GPS and WiFi issues, and sports a 1080p screen (minor upgrade for most users) all at a minor price hike.

The tablet received little use and wasn't subject to any physical harm. As of last week, it just wouldn't turn on. Apparently this is a common problem with this model. I'm furious. Dealing is ASUS is long, monotonous joke.

Content: WiFi issues....i went from 1 star to 5 stars. At this moment I love my prime, but about 6 months ago I was not loving it at all and was left pondering how one could just flush $500 away.  .First off it does everything you want a tablet to do....for entertainment purposes at least (online radio, online movies, internet browsing, etc....)With that in mind, my tablet's WiFi starting getting worse every day after the first month.  It got to the point that it had no range beyond a few feet from the router and became completely worthless very quickly.  Well a little internet search revealed that there was a major design flaw with the prime's regarding their WiFi and GPS antenna. After a scathing email and a stern telephone call to Asus, I was able to return my prime to Asus for repair and within a week they had replaced my WiFi antenna. It was returned to me in much better working condition.  The WiFi speed and range improved significantly.  Where the tablet was once worthless, is not streaming Hi Def videos.  My wife an no longer look down her nose at me while she is surfing the web on your kindle while I am holding an expensive, but fancy paper weight.So if you have one of these and are contemplating putting it in your trash can there is hope.  If you are looking to purchase a TF201 used....BEWARE and steer yourself in another direction.

Content: Loved it While It Lasted. I reluctantly purchased this after extensive research. I bought it through amazon through a third party , refurbished ,sealed with a 90 day manufacturer's warranty. When I recieved the tablet I was so anxious to open it and worried because it is refurbished. Well, I opened the box and the the tablet was in near perfect condition to the naked eye on the physical aspect. Charged it till the light turned green and turned it on. After it loaded up and I looked at the display I noticed a blueish , teal colored line that ran vertically down the left side of the display. No matter which way I held the tablet , landscape or portrait, this blue line seemed permanent. I was very unhappy because it came in perfect condition except for the display problem. I have had to send it off to ASUS for RMA in Texas to fix this and my experience with them so far has not been a good one to say the least. To make a long story short , I took a shot and purchased it and became one of the unlucky ones. If it came with nothing wrong with it , the Prime is an awesome , fast ,tablet, with an excellent display.  I gave 5 stars because if it wasn't flawed, it would be mint.I love and miss my Prime, yep that's right , still haven't gotten it back yet and its been like over two weeks in there posession over at ASUS.  I recommend this tablet if you dont care about the GPS issues. It's awesome.  Best Regards

Content: Viewing Angle. I've got one of these, and I love everything about it specially the screen. That's the part of the tablet I spend the most time with. The viewing angle is amazing. Unlike, my previous other tablets. I kid you not, if you are looking at one part of the screen closely, you're likely going to have to move the tablet in order to see other parts clearly. I can't see what's on the screen when it's sitting flat on my desk, under my chin, directly in front of me. It's really REALLY bad. I am very glad this tablet solve that issue, now it so pleasant to read and watch movie with out worry to fixed in ther right position.  I highly recommend this tablet to other with viewing angle issue.

Content: A bigger version of my HTC Android cellphone. I've been using the Le Pan tablet for about 3-weeks now.  First off, I have an HTC Evo cellphone that runs Android 2.2.  And this Le Pan runs Android 2.2.  So right out of the gate I was pretty familiar with how to run this Tablet.  But, Android 2.2 is not really designed for use in tablets (there is a newer version of Android designed for use by tables).  So for Android 2.2, not all Apps work well on the table; examples:  Words With Friends is not usable on my tablet and I haven't figured out how to adjust it (the bottom few rows are cutoff on the tablet screen), my son reports some of his app games don't work on the tablet, but luckily for my son all the Angry Bird / Angry Frog / Angry Dad games work great on this Le Pan tablet.In terms of the brand I have never heard of Le Pan.  I even googled their name and there is almost no info out there.  Documentation that comes with the tablet is very sparse as is info on the web.  Maybe the info will increase over time.  This type of info is somewhat important for me because I'd like to know if this tablet will be upgradable to the newer version of Android software designed for tablets.  Also this would help me try to make tweaks/fixes to such things as Words With Friends screen size. +My pros:  Does seem to have good build quality (feels solid), Android Market appears as a standard icon and has been easy for me to download apps, screen display is nice, was easy to get up and running and synch to my home wireless, battery life seems decent, takes micro sd memory card so you can add bigger size. -My cons:  Power Button is very tiny and pain in the butt to turn on and off, sometimes the screen will turn back on for no reason, the 4 Android buttons are backlit but only for a few seconds - so if I'm using this thing in a dimily lit room I can't see where the buttons are and I can't figure out how to adjust the backlight timing (I googled around alot trying to figure this out but no luck), the charging cable is kind of a strange size (would prefer standard usb cellphone charging cable), relatively anonymous company so not sure about future support and info (eg; can I upgrade to newer android software, etc).Now compared to iPad, my friends iPad seems much slicker.  His iPad is faster, screen seems brighter, and everything seems integrated together more.  But then again part of this is just the nature of Apple's closed ecosystem vs Androids open ecosystem.Overall, I give this 3.51 stars (rounds up to 4).  It is a usable tablet, and better to use around the house for me than my Android 2.2 cellphone because the screen is bigger.  But, I deducted 1.49 stars for the cons I mentioned above as well as the fact that at $350 this is a bit pricey in consideration of the cons I listed and other Android options that are out there.  If anything notable occurs subsequent to this review then I'll come back and give an update here.

Content: Le Pan 970. Le Pan 970 Tablet is really great. I don't see what IPAD could do that Le Pan can't. The display has the same resolution and the sound is quite reasonable. The few apps I've tried work fine. If you like Androids Le Pan is definitely a very good deal. Of course the 2 Gb disk is a bit on the low side but it can be easily and cheaply upgraded.The real question is what is a tablet like that (or an IPAD) good for? I am still trying to find an answer, but it is definitely not a PC.

Content: Didn't really need a tablet, but now I can't do without it. I work on a computer all day and night, have 2 at work and 2 at home. A Atrix Android phone, so I really didn't need a tablet, but this one was so reasonably priced, and I was curious about reading books on one, but didn't want a Kindle that you have to use a light to read at night in bed. And iPad's were just way too expensive. I got it right before Christmas, so haven't had a lot of time to add a bunch of apps, but LOVE IT. I read in the bathtub, so was worried about that, but a gallon zip lock fits it perfectly (just in case I get water on it). And am loving reading it there and in bed at night. Have used the GPS (google maps) and may look in to a better one, but live in small town, so it isn't really something I need much. It opened up, and looks just like my android phone, so felt right at home. I used to have an iPhone, but traded up to Android. I'm nearly 68 years old, but have alwyas been a geek, so I like the control that android gives me, over a controlled iphone or ipad. So for only about 4 weeks of ownership.. I have to say its a great deal! Its fast, has a beautiful screen and resolution (same as iPads) at a fraction of the cost. And with Amazon's Square Trade 3 year warranty, because its under $200, that was only $29 bucks! How can you beat it?

That is incredibly slow and not nearly as slow as an N connection should be.  These are N routers and G routers. I tried three different brands.Hopefully you won't run into the same issue.

Content: Dubious Reviews - Don't Buy. Careful!  Many of the 5-star reviews seem fake - not the typical reviews of a normal consumer.  This tablet is very poorly made. From the start, we had to reset it several times per day.  It died a week ago and we have had zero luck with the manufacturer.  The support line is always busy and there is no email response.  I looked at other online stores; several have stopped offering this product.  I believe many, many people will continue to have problems with these tablets.

Content: Updated Review, Problems Already! *****Update 1/23/12*****I have now had this table for almost two months I believe? Anyways, I went to turn on my tablet yesterday, and it didn't respond. I figured it was just dead because I do use it a lot, so I put it on the charger. Today, I tried to turn it on, absolutely no response. Tried to reset it: nothing. I am very disappointed in this tablet. I liked it, but there is no excuse for it not working already. I have not dropped it, and always keep it in it's case. Sending it in asap. Hopefully it'll be resolved soon.I got this tablet about a month ago and so far, I love it. There are a few minor issues with it, though.1. The tablet runs on the Adroid 2.2 OS, and from doing some research, I have learned it will not be able to be updated to the 2.3. Minor issue, but one worth noting.2. I've noticed that sometimes, I have to tap an app a few times or harder than normal to get it to open. I'm not sure if it's just me, but I feel the sensitivity should be a little better.3. It's pretty hard to get cases for this tablet because it is an "off brand." I bought a leather case for it thinking it would work, and although it was the correct size, I could not get to the home buttons when the tablet was in the case.4. The camera is only on the front. Which is great to use it as a webcam, but not so great if you want to take pictures of something other than yourself.Other than that, the tablet is great. Easy to use. It seems very well made to me, and worth the money.Works as well as more expensive tablets. Picture is good, and sound quality is also very good.Over all, definitely worth the money.

Content: Easily completes with $400-$500 tablets. I bought my mom one of these for Christmas. She's been using an Ipod touch but her eyesight is going so I got her something with a larger screen. I've been teaching her how to use this and I am very impressed.The tablet has a solid build, doesn't feel cheap at all. Seems like the body will last a long time. Screen is responsive. We don't do anything fancy or use the multitouch features but it always interprets zooming correctly. The only thing that has lagged are youtube videos but I couldn't say whether it was buffering the wifi connection or the processor wasn't going fast enough. We don't do anything real hardcore with it but we have played movies, music, tv shows, games, done websurfing and read books but it hasn't show any lag on anything but youtube. The speakers on it are quite impressive. I hear it will get the upgrade to ICS but haven't been able to confirm that yet.The amount of memory that comes with it is a joke but a 16gb microSD card on amazon was less then $20 and a 32GB is less than 40 so that's not a big deal. The lack of ports is the only reason I didn't get one of these for myself. There's no USB or microUSB port. There are not many accessories for it. We are having trouble finding a case since most tablets are 10.1" not 9.7" and I haven't seen a case made specifically for this tablet.In general, this tablet competes with the big boys. It isn't the lightest or the thinnest, it doesn't have tons of ports and features, but it works and it works well at half the price. I heartily recommend this tablet.

Content: 5 Star Knockout !!! What can I say about this tablet that hasn't already been stated?  Purchased this for my wife.  Received on January 21st.  Charged it up, turned it on and it immediately recognized my network.  Typed in the access code and was off and running.  Brought the Le Pan II to my sons house and it immediately recognized his network, also.  It worked flawlessly on both networks.  My son was blown away by this unit and now wants one.  And, he is a long time Android user.  My wife brought it in to work.  One of her colleagues has already ordered one and another is seriously thinking of doing the same.Response time is as good as her Pentium dual core notebook.  Videos from Youtube, Netflix, Crackle, games, etc. all stream smoothly with no hesitation.  I have not experienced poor network connection, jerky or buffering video issues that a couple of posters have mentioned.  And, I'm pretty fussy.  Any issues I have experienced were application specific and had nothing to do with the Le Pan II.  There is a minute amount of bleeding in the corners from the LEDs used to backlight the screen.  But it is not noticeable when playing any video content.  I have the same effect on a 22 inch Samsung LCD TV.  This is truly not even worth mentioning.  But someone raised this point in a previous post.  Placed a video call using Tango.  Video and audio synced well.  The video coming from my sons end was not great, but he has a low res camera and he was in a dimly lit room at the time.  Will have to try again under better conditions.  As others have stated, this unit has a quality feel and the screen is incredible.  Nice touch sensitivity across the entire screen.  The fact that it has GPS capability without the need for 3G network connection is a nice bonus.  It's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capable.  Battery life is great!!!  We are new to the Tablet and Android OS world.  The Le Pan II compares favorably to my wife's laptop, in many ways, and I can't imagine anyone not being thrilled with this unit.Purchased the Targus Truss case for the HP touchpad and everyone has been as impressed with the case as with the Le Pan II.  Have also purchased a class 10 32gb micro sd card and screen protector.

Content: Definitely a surprise! This tablet has been amazing so far.  One of the things I do need to say is that if you have any issues, there is an update for it that seems to fix them.  I had looked at probably 30+ tablets, many that were cheaper, but not as up to date (one at Big Lots that was $89, but only had Android 1.5).  I had considered the Kindle Fire, but the main thing that turned me away from that was not being able to add a memory card to it.  I have been surprised so many times with this tablet, being able to play some Facebook games on it, having the full Android market, and the camera isn't too bad.Pros:PriceSize (doesn't feel like there's wasted space, like an Ipad)Can play most Facebook gamesAccess to full Android MarketCons:Without update, almost not usable when battery gets lowFingerprints show up bad (though at the right angle, almost not visible)Speakers are a bit roughI definitely recommend this tablet to anyone that has been wanting to get one, but does not have the money for an Ipad or other "name-brand" tablet.  I can't stress enough though...get the update instantly, it will make a difference.

Content: Excellentttttt Item!!!!!! so i just recived my lepan 2 in the mial today. ive been playing around with it for the past few hours! i will hoestly say i was kinda iffy on getting the lepan 2 only because i had never heard of the product name before. so i spent about 2 1/2 weeks doing tons and tons of research on the lepan t970 when i stumbled accross the lepan 2. so i then started looking into that one already having liked the first one. i didnt really find as much about the second one. but read that the android market was upgradeable and that i wanted! i spent 295 dollars with shipping on my lepan 2 and let me just say....the price....is UNBEATABLE! i love the expandable storage (which they dont have on the ipad) the adobe flash player!(also not on the ipad) this is such an amazinggg product! while doing research i did notice alot of people saying  that the screen had a pretty bad glare and had very noticible fingerprints so being someone who like my things looking new anyway i purchased a anitglare and anti fingerprint screen! and it works amazinggg. i deff can say my money was well spent. Very High quality! not cheap like at all! and i was worried being such a low price that it may seem cheap....but its not! i love it! and im so glad that i decided to order andother one due to arrive tomorrow for my fiance! who is absolutlyyyy going to loveee it! no questions asked this product is GREATTTTTT! well worht the moneyy!!!

Content: Great tablet.  Great Value. This is a nice tablet.  The screen is nice & bright and very responsive.  I used to have a Samsung Galaxy Tab and I sold it after I got this tablet.  This does everything my Galaxy Tab would do for less than half the price.I have never had any issues with it freezing or locking up.  The first thing I did when I received it was to upgrade it to the latest firmware.  I also bought a couple of extra charging cables for it.  You can use an iPad charging cable if you carve away a tiny strip of plastic on them - which is very easy to do.  Aftermarket iPad cables are plentiful and cheap.I was tempted to buy the Le Pan II but it was out of stock.  It probably wouldn't be worth the extra $ for me anyway.  This tablet does everything I want.

Content: Nice tablet but freezes. Very nice design and fun to use but the screen started freezing on the 2nd day I had it. I called the manufactor and was told to stick a pin in the reset hole. This works but after 1 month of use the tablet continues to freeze randomly. I had the same problem with my Android phone, so maybe this is an Android problem and not specific to this tablet, or maybe not.

Content: Great... when it works. We bought this for our daughter's 8th birthday, despite mixed feelings because of the many negative reviews. It is really affordable, looks great, is easy to use right out of the box. It was fast, responsive, and fun. It even has a camera and pretty good sound, a big plus. Unfortunately, it started to freeze only days after we got it. Sometimes it would turn on; sometimes not. The battery wasn't the problem; it did hold a charge for quite a while. It just randomly froze without warning. Also, we started having lots of connectivity problems (on our home wireless wi-fi, when we had no problems on our other computers). After a few weeks, we finally threw in the towel and returned it to Amazon. We're not going to take a chance on it again; all the negative reviews unfortunately have proven true. We'll get another tablet, maybe the Kindle Fire.

Content: Le Pan II 9.7-Inch Tablet (Black) I received my Le Pan II about three weeks ago....To say I am impressed would be an understatement.  It arrived within a week as promised.  My device connected to the internet in under three minutes and I was up and running.  Downloads speeds were quite surprising as well as watching netflicks and U-tube.  I would suggest you purchase the antiglare antifingerprint protector, it will be well worth the investment.  I obtained a nice tablet holder from Wilsons leather, which also fits the IPAD, it appears the majority of their holders also fit the Le Pan II, so it won't be hard to find.  Overall for the value of this product against the IPAD, it is well worth it.

With the available APPS I have now a calender, Word Ducument and I can watch Movies and Read books. I'm not using it much for E-Mail and I don't do Live stream so this was perfect for me. And it cost much less than the big brand names.

Content: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!1. First let me say I am an Amazon customer, but did not purchase the LE PAN TC 970 from Amazon, however to be fair, i have had it for over a month, it froze a few times, as you will notice from most of the reviewers, but with the reset, it would then work ok.  It would automatically kick itself off my WIFI, but when it worked it was very fast in downloading apps, and web pages.  My son loves Thomas the train, and there is only one Android Thomas app, (no fault of Le Pan) but when you go to the official Thomas website the puzzle game is not optimized for play, so my son gets frustrated with it, and i know it is the android market, because he is able to play those same puzzles on my computer with no problem.  To get to the meat of the matter, you cannot delete an app from the home screen, even after moving it to one of the extended screens, it still sits on the home screen. Well, I hate this thing now, because it stopped working completely this morning! no amount of trying to reset it will make it turn on, so imagine my explaining to my 3 year old, that his tablet is broken, and he will have to go back to his VTECH reader, he took it in good strides, luckily because is dad and I, always tell him these are just "things" they can be gone in a second!Please double think before you purchase, if you want cheap go for this, just be prepared it may be broken and gone after one month!, he never dropped it, and i was right there with him this morning playing his ROARY game when it just went blank.  Of course my 30 days return is up so I cannot return it, and Le Pan's customer service will not be available before Monday.  If you need a tablet for yourself or child, just make a good choice, and proper investment, we paid $250 for it, and still thought it was reasonable, but I guess reasonable is not good enough!!  Will update again, when I call their customer service

Content: Exceptional budget tablet. As of writing, this tablet now supports CyanogenMod7, which is Android 2.3. (Gingerbread). By contrast, the stock ROM comes with Android 2.2 (Froyo), which is still acceptable but obviously suboptimal for a tablet that can run something better. A brief Google search will get you started. I was able to switch everything over in about an hour.Second, the battery life for this thing is amazing. I charge it so infrequently that I'm often taken aback by how much power it's not using in between charges. I can't even remember the last time I had to plug it in, though I tend to charge it up anyway just in case the zombie apocalypse happens while I'm at work and I need to locate safe houses on my way to the capitol or something. Anyway, if you're looking for a tablet that can do better than "maybe 6 hours on a single charge if you're lucky", this is the way to go.Other pros include surprisingly powerful speakers, good Wi-fi reception even with a low signal, an acceptable screen for the price, and so on. Although I wouldn't say it's designed specifically to be ergonomic, it's still comfortable to hold. Pretend it's a Dualshock for maximum grip comfort.Not much to say when it comes to negatives. Since it's not Honeycomb, actual made-for-tablet-app support is somewhat spotty. About half of my apps notice it's a tablet anyway. The other half just run in regular mode. I've yet to have this be a big issue, but I do wish I could use all the new tablet apps out there. Other than that, the glossy screen smudges easily, which is what you signed up for when you get a tablet in general I suppose. Customer service is limited from what I hear, although it's not like Android is really complicated enough to warrant its necessity. Overall, no dealbreakers, but some downsides.Note to those who bought this, I've found Acase Premium Leather Slimline Carrying Case for Apple iPad and HP TouchPad (Black) to be the best choice for a case. Fits perfectly, power button remains open for use, etc.

Content: I like it! I first saw the Le pan on HSN and was impressed by the presentation, and the 5 payments of $50 and change!  I don't have a smart phone and won't have one for awhile, until my Verizon contract is up lol and have been interested in a tablet.  This got my attention so I ordered it!  I really like it- it's fun.  I think it's not for high-tech people, but for us just getting into the tablet game at a price we can afford.  I can do what I want to do on it-watch youtube, tv, netflix, play around with apps, etc, in any room of my house because of the wifi and if I ever feel like taking advantage of the front-facing camera there are possibilities like Skype and chat.  I'm new to Android so it's been a learning experience!Le Pan TC 970 9.7-Inch Multi-Touch LCD Google Android Tablet PC

Content: Nice Tablet For The Money!! I have had my LePan II for over three months now and have had very little problems. For my purposes, it is a very nice tablet. I check my emails, surf the internet, and have downloaded games and other apps. I wasn't crazy about the volume rocker and downloaded volume in notification from the Play Store. Works great.....no more fiddling with the volume rocker! I have found a couple of games that downloaded fine but didn't load....Temple Run was one of them. Bummer! Not sure if it's the tablet or the app. I also have transferred movies and music from my notebook to the tablet and they play fine. You may have to check around the Play Store for the best video players to play your movies .........some will play one format smoothly but not the other. I have a 32gb micro sd card for storage which really makes enjoying the tablet nice.For the time I've have it, I have had to reset it twice. I never had a wi-fi problem but since the v118 update it sometimes disconnects after being in sleep mode a long time. At first I panicked but now neither of these two things turned out to be a big deal (so far) to me.  I just either re-connected to wi-fi or powered down and restarted. The only thing I'm waiting for now is the HDMI cable to be available and the HDMI option to re-appear back in settings.I know people are concerned about the upgrade to ICS. I'm not familiar with ICS so I don't know how much the upgrade will improve the performance of the LePan II.  For the time being Honeycomb has fulfilled most of my needs.Check out the Le Pan Life Forum for a ton of info on the LePan. Overall, a nice tablet for the money!!

Content: This is a great tablet, FOR THE 9 DAYS IT WORKED! I've only had this tablet for 5 days now, but boy is it nice! I was considering the iPad, but the price was out of reach for me. I happened to stumble accross this one here on Amazon. I read the reviews, watched many videos on YouTube and decided to take the plunge and order it. I thought why not give it a try? Amazon has great return policies. I considered the fact that it was a tablet, and a brand name I had never heard of, so I bought the extended warranty for it as well. I am a Tech, so I figured I could fix it if it broke, but the $60 price of the warranty was a no brainer.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of it so far. It's fast, the screen is great, and it's internal memory is expandible up to 32gb. The build quality is solid and I like the aluminum back. The only thing I found was a little flimsy was the power cord end where it plugs in to the Le Pan. It felt like the plastic end was a little thin and hollow feeling. It picks up my wi-fi signal very well. There is no lag when watching You Tube or Netflix.The only real downfall I see as of right now is the lack of accessories. Maybe that will change as this gains market share, but don't expect to go to your local retailer and pick up a case or extra charger and cable. I did buy a case for it here on Amazon that was custom made for the Le Pan 1 and 2 and it fits great!It's hard to find a used iPad at this price, and this tablet is every bit as good as an iPad 2 at more than half the cost. Go ahead and order it. You can return it if you don't like it, but I bet you end up being very happy with it.UPDATED: I had it for 9 days and loved it, but it wouldn't turn on today. Had it plugged in to the charger all night. No Le Pan logo, nothing...It was a really nice tablet for the 9 days it worked. I thought I would get something comparable to Apple, and it was,but It should last for more than 9 days.I'm going to buy an iPad.

Content: DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.... RUN AWAY NOW! This is criminal.  I am returning this product now.  They are selling this fraudulently.  There is a known wifi issue with this tablet...and they do not ever plan to fix it...and service knows about it.  You will work fine for a week or so...and then wifi will stop working...and no amount of effort will restore it...it is all over the web now...they are only fixing it on the le pan ii model....right...how nice of the them to sell this old crap that they know has an wifi issue.  I never write negative reviews...but this is so fraudulent...and broken.I have spent 2 weeks trying to fix this being lead down a path....that has not end...besides returning this piece of junk.  You get what you pay for in this case.  My ipad, Iphone and other gear just works.  This is not ready for prime time at all...this company should be ashamed of itself.  What kind of people would waste our time...Shame on you Le PAN....shame on you.You will get what you deserve.  You can not hide from the masses with social media in the hands of the masses...A totally ticked off customer...

Content: better than a kindle. I bought this to replace a kindle gift which failed miserably in all respects.  It has proven exceptional as an e-reader for library e-books.  It came with an outlet charger so that even though the battery lasts about 8 hours, I can continue to read while seated in my comfortable reading chair.  It charges from an outlet near the chair.  It has google android 2.2, which means that I can not use it access audio books via overdrive service which requires version 2.4.  I do not believe I can upgrade the android version.  It has a sharp picture, adjustable spacing and type size and type.  It connects effortlessly to the wifi.  It has not frozen though I have had it operational on battery for 4-5 hours at a time.  It has other applications which I do not use as much as the reader as it is a tablet computer and not meant as an e-reader.  At a cost of $199 it provides considerably more than than similarly priced Amazon or Barnes and Nobel readers.  Its larger screen 9.7 inches creates the illusion of reading a paper book and it is comfortable to hold. For a technophobe such as myself it has provided a wonderful and painless access to my library system's e-books.

Content: What I paid for ! I bought my Le Pan II a few weeks ago and was quite pleased. This was a good buy !well worth the money! The only problem was the inability to use the HDMI feature. It seems the 30pin to HDMI connector was not designed well enough and tech support can only say "They're working on it"!I hope it's available soon. In the meantime I watch on my tablet. I am not disappointed. Expect the Le Pan III to have fixed that. I'll gift this to my wife and buy it !! Seem though that the U.S Market is resistant though. The tablet market needs better products like this one!Le Pan II 9.7-Inch Tablet (Black)

Content: Best price and value for such a LARGE tablet! Surpassed my expectations!  Great price, great product, great deal!  Upgraded to ICS in about 20 minutes and havent looked back since.  Would buy this product again if I needed another one.  Love it.Screen is larger then imagined; the tablet is super responsive and the graphics are as great or even better then that of the Ipad.  I purchased the Le Pan 2 tablet, 32gb Micro-sd card, tablet case and screen protector all for less then HALF of the cost of an Ipad.If your questioning this product due to its lack of notoritiy, please dont.  This is a great product and the ONLY thing holding it back in any way is its lack of familuarity in name.I expect this company to continue to do great things and build on its reasonably priced products... if I could buy stock in Le Pan I would.

Content: Great Tablet at a great price! My 6 year old has been begging for an Ipad.  (Yeah right!!!)  So we started looking into tablets and found this one.  He's had it about 6 months and loves it!  He can do youtube, email, facebook, etc.  He has downloaded all the angry birds and other various games.  The flashplayer is great, it doesn't skip or anything.  The only thing that doesn't work is skype.  You can make calls with skype, but it doesn't do video chat, so that was misleading.  There is a camera, but it's on the back of the tablet.  It's also set up just like my android phone so my son took to using it with ease.  I downloaded the kindle app so he can read books.  I've actually borrowed it to read books on it myself!  Very happy with this purchase.

Content: A good tablet. Compared to my ipad and now Kindle Fire, this is definitely at the low end.  Great looking screen and good speed on most programs.  However the touch screen would be a bit buggy and web pages were difficult to manage.  Some would fail completely.  Overall a decent tablet for the price.

Looking for a  tablet that was easy for a group to use together in order to reduce the amount of papers distributed at a meeting.Purchased 10 more units. Costs were 140 dollars per unit and were delivered in less than a week.Purchase through Walmart because of their easy return policy.The power hookup is a little hinky.  Resembles an iPod's---  long thin plug in. But is not interchangeable.

Content: Painful Experience. I received the product within a reasonable time from seller PST (Poppy Seeds Toms) and was super excited when I received it. This was my 1st tablet. My 17yr old wanted one for Christmas and I thought, 'I am not getting her one without getting myself one'. Like others on here, I researched, read and decided on the one to get. She wanted a 7 inch ( so I purchased another brand for her AGPTek) but I thought I would try this one and see the difference in the 2 and I got me the LePan II.Out of the box, it was nice and it worked. I have 2 jobs and I like having my smartphone or laptop handy to work when necessary. The Lepan II did that... I was comfortable in my purchase. My daughter AGPTek came and it was ok but not as good as my LePan so I got her a Samsung (which is great by the way), bought anohter AGPTek and gave them to my sisters for Christmas.Everything was great until mine (the more expensive of them all) just stopped powering on. I was sick for a few days after Christmas and I just laid in the bed and used no type device to do anything. I didn't purchase a case for the tablet so I kept it in the plastic and in the box ( out of fear). I set up for about 1 week, no use at all. I am getting ready to return to work after the holidays and I wanted to begin checking emails and getting up to date... It would not power on. I thought ' it's dead, put it on the charger'. It sat on the charger for 5 hours, and it never came on. I read the suggestions from LePan on their website and other LePan forums and did all they suggested (hit reset, hit pwr for 30 sec,  reset + pwr, reset+ volume up, reset+ volume dwn, reset+ pwr and volume) nothing worked. I then saw someone that said they returned it to Amazon. So I contacted the seller (marketplace), who even gave me something to do (they said, that is the ICS for you), still nothing. I contacted LePan and I was on hold for over an hour, at work! I sent then an email, filled out the form..I contacted the seler again saying I want a refund.. they told me it was past their 14-15 day policy and that I needed to contact LePan. Well, that policy was not listed, they reference Amazon's policy so Amazon has put in a claim to get me refunded from the seller. The seller and I have gone back and forth as they do not believe that I am telling the truth (first they said, I was past the return point, then they said I probably broke it, then after they received they said it was heavily used and I switched the machine and sent them another one). So on top of this tablet not working, I am being called a crook by the seller.I am still waiting on that refund, but it hasn't been the 5 business days.Nonetheless, I wanted so bad to like this tablet. I loved the size and I love Androids but after less than 10 days of use, the power shouldn't be the issue. Furthermore, there shouldn't be this many people talking about this same issue. The thing just stopped coming on.I am an Amazon shopper. I don't like shopping and I hate large crowds, so sitting at my computer and shopping has been my thing. For the past 2 years, I have gone to the store at most 2 times during the Holidays. This experience, with the machine and especially with the seller had me in tears on Monday. I believe in shopping around and getting the best for the best price but my sanity was challenged with this purchase. It is already fearful purchasing online and especially electronic, but to feel hopeless like I have felt for the past 2 weeks with the seller and this machine will push me away. This is ridiculous.

Content: Good for a year. Bought this about 18 months ago.  It worked good and I was pleased with it.  Especially after upgrading to Ice Cream Sandwich.  However, I have found that buying accessories for this is difficult because it isn't a "major brand" item.  Also, after one year of use, the 30 pin plug on the tablet broke and the pins bent in rendering the unit useless.  There isn't any support for repairing my tablet and nowhere in my city will even think of replacing the broken part.  I have purchased an ASUS Transformer to replace it and very pleased with it.

Content: one star rating is too much for this product. This is the worst product that I have purchased. It goes to the web page it wants to, turns on when it wants, is not at all consistant so that you can at least fgure out what went wrong. At times it is super sensitive to you touch other times you can pound on it and nothing happens. I can not send an email from my email account and most of the time I have to fight it to even access my email. I do not recommend this product to anyone. I almost paid nothing and that was too much.

Content: Best affordable Tablet out there.... Hands down!! I bought my girlfriend a Galaxy Tab 2, which is an amazing tablet. I used hers a few times and decided that I wanted a tablet too, but did not want to spend another $350 dollars. I started to search for reviews of cheaper tablets and ran across this LePan 2 tablet. Decided to give it a try. I am very pleased. It does everything that her Galaxy Tab does. Just as quickly and flawlessly, I might add. Her and I sat side by side and loaded the same videos and programs at exactly the same time.. There was little to no difference in the speed. Other than small very small differences in picture quality, I find this tablet very comparable to the Galaxy Tab 2. The picture quality is excellent and HD. Just when comparing it to the Galaxy Tab, side by side, The Galaxy picture is a little sharper, but I think I only noticed because I had them side by side with the exact same video playing. It loads youtube, netflix, HBO Go and any other video from any other site that I have tried flawlessly without lag. The battery life is great and the tablet speed is great. This tablet is easily comparable to tablets well out of its price range. I know that many of the reviews on here talk of issues upgrading the software. I did not have this issue, but mine was already upgraded when I purchased it, so I cannot speak of the ease or difficulty of this action, but I would recommend this tablet to anyone. If I had to complain at all, which I am just knit picking by saying this. The power button is a little small and while the sound quality is good, I wish the speakers were on the front like they are on the Galaxy Tab. These are very tolerable issues, but worthy of mention.

Content: This tablet is a dud!! I purchased this tablet on August 8, 2012, had to return to Amazon for a replacement. The second one worked ok for about 4 months then just "died". I returned it to LePan, they sent me another one in April. This one turned out to be worthless also, so  I  returned this one also.  Le Pan sent me another one, the Le Pan ll, which also turned out to be a dud. I am now returning the Le Pan ll for yet another one! This will be my sixth tablet. Wish I could get a refund so I could buy a GOOD one!

Content: I can't kill this thing! I bought the Le Pan 970 about 2 years ago because (a) it was on sale and (b) it packs a TON of features that I need. This wasn't going to be for average use, I installed it in my car as a music player, GPS, and on occasion digital gauge display for MPH/fuel economy/engine temp/etc. I have it connected to a generic 2A USB charge that is triggered with the key. I use Tasker to control the system by telling it when to sleep/wake up and when the screen should remain on/off. It is subject to severe hot and cold weather, vibration, and is often left for days (sometimes well over a week) in a sleep state with literally no problems at all. It refuses to die or malfunction in any way whatsoever, even without being reset or turned off for months at a time.The pluses: GPS works great even in bad weather and inside the car. Bluetooth is very stable and connects to my OBDII dongle every time if need be (I have another tablet that handles the gauges 99% of the time, but this serves as a backup). Screen is excellent even in direct sunlight. Even after days on standby the battery never drops below 50%, and quickly charges up even with the screen on full-time and max brightness. Refuses to malfunction or shut-off without my prompting.The negatives: No Android updates from the manufacturer. Limited aftermarket ROMs. No USB hosting (that I'm aware of). The processor is considered dated, and I have run into stuttering audio while trying to run intensive programs in tandem, although I've only had this happen while trying to run Co-Pilot as my navigation. I switched to Sygic and the problem stopped completely. The camera is rough at best, and the built-in speakers are headache inducing at anything but low volume, although these are common problems with any tablet in this price range and of this age.I've used several different tablets in my car (Nook Color running various flavors of CM, MID a81e, Lenovo a2107), and because they've all been on the "budget" side of things none of them except for the Le Pan have performed very well. The 970 has not only performed well in terms of performance and stability but gone above-and-beyond my wildest dreams in terms of sheer longevity and tenaciousness.

Content: Good hardware for the money. Not much else. This is a good tablet for what you pay. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have probably mentioned, the support is nil. You're better off going with a more main-stream name brand.  Inability to keep the hard keys lit for low light reading is just one of the several annoying things that will probably never get fixed due to this product's zero support from the manufacturer.

Content: Great Tablet! Bought this for my son's birthday and it is great.  All of his phone Android apps automatically downloaded once he signed in with his gmail account.  It is true the speakers require a really quiet room to be effective but we haven't tried the equalizer app yet (he wears ear buds).Pros - Screen, OS, Battery Life, rubber backingCons - Speakers and CameraFor the money - hands down best buy on a tablet.

Content: Really great Android tablet for the money. I've been hesitant to buy a tablet as I expected it to have difficulty keeping up with my daily routines at work and at home. But to my surprise, this reasonably priced tablet works really really well. The Ice Cream sandwich upgrade is fantastic and really brings a big usability upgrade. I can't wait to upgrade my Galaxy S2 as ICS packs a nice punch. The tablet feels pretty zippy and between the Market (now Google Play, yeesh) and the Amazon appstore, I can really set this baby up for a whole day at work with little compromise. The new ICS calendar and exchange email work really well and have alot of functionality. Dropbox is a must have for instant syncing of important files. Games play and look great. For a real heavy duty geek, I'm sure the Tegra 2 chip is "so last year" but it seems very capable to me. I sat next to my friend while he was using his twice as expensive Ipad2 and I can't say I was jealous at all. Well worth the money.

Content: Great for the price I paid! Wooted a refurbished Acer Iconia A200 for $205 including shipping. I bought it to use while I teach CAD class to look at my reference material while I have the CAD software open on the laptop screen and projector. While I won't be able to try that until classes resume this fall, in the meantime, this has been my 'go-to' device for a quick look at Facebook, check on the weather, or a game of Solitaire.  The first time my pre-teen step-daughter saw me with it, she asked, "Who's iPad is that?" Granted, she was across the room, but I honestly don't know what additional utility I personally would get from the iPad that this doesn't do. I guess the backside camera to shoot video, but we have other devices for that.Battery life seems good. I can't say how many hours I get. It's not like me to spend long hours on a tablet. Suffice it to say at this point that I am satisfied with the required frequency of charging.Setup out of the box was fast and easy. Wireless at my home and at work have been 100% reliable. I'm getting used to the touch screen typing. (I'm not even a smartphone user, yet.). Biggest frustration so far has been correcting text. I miss having an arrow key to navigate to the errant spot.Whites on the screen are very white, while black is very black. Resolution is better than my retinas apparently, as I haven't noticed any pixelation.In addition to my minor gripe about navigation within text, I really don't have any other gripe with it.  As this is my first tablet, I don't have any reference point, hence my reluctance to give it 5 stars.I rated it 4 out of 5. If I learn any thing more, I'all update the post.

Content: Awesome tablet for $300. I gave this a five star rating because its exactly that, five stars! This tablet is very good and i love it. I originally got this product as a Christmas gift last year. Played around on it and i didn't like the preloaded apps so i rooted it and then it really went downhill. The apps crashed and a lot weren't working, it was very annoying so i decided just to buy another one. The size of this tablet is perfect and the weight is very lite. The 2.0 megapixel web camera is better then my laptop and my ipod and it doesn't bother me that there is no back camera. I enjoy the USB port so that i can transfer pictures, videos, and documents from my laptop to my tablet. The micro SD card that can hold up to 32GB which helps save space on my tablet. It takes 4 hours for a full charge which is pretty good. The screen is pretty bright with the brightness all the way up. The only disappointing thing is the speakers, not the greatest but it does the job it needs to plus if i plug in my earphones i could probably go deaf because it so loud so overall im very happy with this and probably will be for a long time

Content: great tablet. This is very good tablet, of the three we own this has quickly become my favorite. I could care less about a rear camera. I still use my laptop for serious work but for playing games, surfing the internet this is great. Do not let the lack of a so so rear camera push you away. You would probably never use it.

Content: Can't Beat The Price Point. I will be brief with this as most everyone else has already captured my praise for this item.I picked up a refurb A200 from 1SaleaDay for $160 and this thing is flat out perfect for me in regard to the combination of utilization for business and entertainment. It is fast, works well on ICS 4.0 (with an upgrade arriving soon from Acer for JB 4.1), and basically offers you everything you could want. With a battery life between 7.5 and 9.5 hours (on my usage), it gives me all the juice I need to get through a few days of sporadic use here and there.Quite simply, I highly recommend this unit to anyone out there looking for a rock solid 10" tab that can basically do it all for you.

Content: Poor Excuse for a Tablet Computer. I have always liked Acer products. However this was not one I enjoyed. This tablet was just an advertising device for Google. The Google OS (Android) is very bad. I did not like much about it. Network connectivity was very poor. For security reasons, I like to give my devices a static (permanent) address on my network. Well with this device, I was unable to connect using a static IP. I had to revert to dynamic. I would not recommend this device.

Content: 3 means it's ok. Which is it, Pros and Cons. I've worked on computers most of my life, so I didn't just fall off of the turnip truck when it comes to technology. I was never really into android, linux, or any of the mac based operating systems, always been a windows guy myself. I've used Android a little bit on other people tablet pcs, phones etc. The learning curve isn't bad at all, once you realize how everything works it's a bit tedious but you get use to it. I've also been using Acer products since about 1997 or so, so I tend to stick with what i know is good and what has treated me well. Acer itself has had it's ups and downs just like any other company. Other than the IPAD, the Acer Iconia along with the Motorola Zoom were some of the first out on the market with what's now referred to as "tablet PC's". One of the main reasons i chose the Iconia Tablet is because of it's USB abilities, being one of the only ones i've seen on the market with an actual port. The problem is, it's very fickle whether or not it will recognize the device you plug in, some may, some won't. Also once you plug it in, it's extremely difficult to find out where the content is, and/if it will indeed play it or not. Even syncing it up with other devices was a task and it took forever to bring up hardly any of the content from an actual external HD. You can just plug it directly into the PC to transfer files, but that defeats the purpose of me getting this model. It i wanted to do that i would have gotten and IPAD, Sony Tablet, or Samsung Galaxy. So here......Pros-Good battery life, decent sound, plenty of apps, great wifi connectivity. Decent speed, good graphics for the games it gives you, lots of free things. Updates to Android 4.0 ICS. Supports the latest version of Utorrent, which works great. Nice solid feel, the USB port(was a plus).Cons-Bulkier than most Tablet PCs. Even though i said the sound is decent it's not really loud enough. The screen is washed out, definitely not as good as the Iconia A500, non vibrant. Navigation isn't that smooth, lags a bit, (of course remember this is the cheap version of this tablet), and it's NOT an IPAD. The USB recognition problem which i have yet to fix. Also finding files from your USB device is a pain. Color is very drab. Camera is awful.So like most reviewers have said it's basically just your BASIC tablet pc, nothing special, and there was no real need to go from the A500, A100, to this. So i may keep it, i may not, it all depends on the USB issue. That's why the biggest percentage of people get this one, so they don't have to sync up or plug into a main computer to get files they want. Although there are plenty of apps on this thing, if you don't have WIFI your dead in the water for anything to do on it. So be sure you read this before buying, and if you want to use the transfer cable, be my guest. But there are much better tablets (more expensive) to do that with. And it defeats the purpose of the Acer Iconia.

Third party technician examined it and determined the central processor is dead.  For a $300+ investment it really should have lasted more than a year and a couple months.

Content: My First Tablet - a hdtv in your hand. I was almost considering the iPad2 for portability but ended up getting  an 11inch macbook air last year.  Yet with all the convenience a tablet has over a  laptop  I've been waiting for this retina screen and pre ordered  my first tablet a Black 16Gb 4G At&t; on the first day of release. Glad to have skipped the earlier 2 Gen's of iPad.With just few hours  of usage, I realized how convenient it is for everyday browsing and entertainment.  Retina screen really made a huge difference.  It truly appears like an hdtv in your hand. Definitely recommend buying it. For some reasons I've always  tried to stay away from  Apple products due to their higher  price etc.,  But over years, I find myself  accumulating Apple products  starting with my first purchase a 3rd gen Nano to  this current iPad 3.  I feel their products  are really designed for convenience, there is so much attention given to minor  things that other brands do not care about.  This factor alone makes me forget about their price.

Content: Good for Reading. I didn't buy the first and second generation iPads because I didn't like the resolution. I opted for the Kindle DX instead which is more suitable for reading. But the newest generation iPad has a better resolution and smoothness of text compared to the first and second generation iPads and it's much better than the Kindle DX reading device. The only issue is the screen glaring which is not comfortable if sitting nearby the light source.IMHO it's worth to upgrade from iPad two if you read a lot of text and watch HD videos on netflix. For other uses like occasional browsing, reading emails and gaming: The iPad 2 is a good option for a lower price.

Content: Decent upgrade from the iPad2; some compromise. I love my iPad 2. The weight and size was about the max that I thought I could withstand in a handheld device.  For me, the iPad 3 is a set of compromises that I decided was worth it in the end.Weight/thickness: If you hold your iPad a lot when using it, then I think you will notice the extra heft of the third gen iPad.  It's not major, but it's noticeable. I find that I become a fatigued more quickly when reading in bed or holding the iPad on the plan while watching a movie, etc.Heat:  Yes, it runs a lot warmer than my iPad 2.  You will notice it.  The heat adds to the overall fatigue, largely because the greatest heat occurs exactly where you hold the iPad in portrait mode (lower left corner). Sure would have been nice if they cold have flipped something around inside to put the greatest heat elsewhere.Screen:  Nice improvement over the iPad2.  Makes reading easier on the eyes.  No more jagged fonts. When I go back to reading on my iPad 2, I wonder how in the word I managed with it.  Colors are more vibrant too.  I won't call is revolutionary, but it is a very nice upgrade.  At the end of the day, my iPad 2 would still be fine if I had never seen the iPad 3 screen.LTE:  This is a major selling point for me.  AT&T; LTE has been faster than both my home and work WiFi.  I did notice that LTE drains the battery very quickly, however.  I saw a 10% drop in battery within about 15 minutes while using LTE.  Battery drain was much slower when I jumped onto my work wifi.Overall:  I am happy with the new iPad, but I do find that I miss the smaller size and weight of the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 "disappears" when you use it, which was Steve Job's main objectives.  The iPad 3 does not have the same effect.  The screen pulls you in, but the extra heft becomes apparent more quickly.  IF the heft doesn't become noticeable, the heat will get your attention.  The heat is within acceptable limits, but it is there to remind you that you are holding an electronic device.  It's harder to get lost in that book or movie.  So if the magic of the iPad disappearing is important to you, then wait for the fourth gen which is bound to be lighter and cooler.  If you want a graphics and LTE workhorse that you will use on a table more than holding free-form in your hand, then the iPad 3 is a good choice.  Overall, I prefer the iPad 2 for the reason that it does disappear and pull you in.  Already waiting to see if the iPad 4 returns to this experience.

Content: The New ipad, to be or not to be? My review is divided in to 2 parts. The pre purchase and the post purchase review.The prepurchase review:The release of the new iPad has left many of us in a state of indecisiveness. People who own, and those who have never owned an iPad are facing the same dilemma, to be or not to be. Most of us had high hopes that the new iPad would put an end to our life-long quest for an ideal tablet. Unfortunately, it did not. It now seems that the new iPad is more of an option rather than an upgrade to its predecessor. The market for iPad 2 therefore has not closed. In fact, even before the release of their 3rd generation tablet, apple had already announced that they will continue to manufacture iPad 2 and sell it at a reduced price.The purpose of this article is to help you decide whether you should buy the new iPad or stick with its predecessor. So, let us take a look at different scenarios where one version may be preferred over the other and vice versa. But first let's summarize all the important issues that have made the new iPad center of criticism.In the order of preference:1. overheating: it is now a common knowledge that the new iPad is running 13 degrees hotter than its predecessor. There can be two important implications of this issue. First, many people have pointed that they feel uncomfortable when holding the warm tablet for prolonged lengths of time. This feeling might become worse in the hot weather, especially when there is no AC to cool you and your iPad down. Imagine holding a sick child who has a fever of 102 degrees, but this baby is running a temperature of 116 degrees. Second, many have raise concerns over the effects of the high temperature on iPad's delicate hardware.2. Wifi connectivity: there are enough whiners on apple forum complaining about the new iPad's noticeably inferior wifi reception. For some this problem is more annoying than the heating issue.3. Battery: it takes twice the time to charge the new iPad to full than iPad 2. It has also been seen that the new iPad is falsely displaying a 100% charge figure when in fact it is continuing to load its battery for at least another hour after the percentage is displayed. Another, even bigger disappointment is the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy duty' app, such as games, videos or multitasking.4. Voracious appetite for data: being an HD model, understandably it needs more fuel to run than the previous models. I wish there was some kind of 'standard mode' that people could switch to inorder to conserve data, unfortunately, there isn't.5. Higher demand for memory: since most of its apps must be HD, and therefore 'heavy', the need for both static as well as Random Access Memory is naturally higher. Unfortunately, this entire HD concept has transcribed in to rendering the cheapest member of its family, the 16GB, more or less dysfunctional, at least for the aggressive tablet users. So if you want to buy anything 'functional' you must pick 32 GB or higher version.7. Few more ounces: This is not really a major issue but people who are used to holding the previous versions argue that the additional ounces further decrease the number of hours they could support the tablet on their palm. I personally believe that the heating factor would have kicked in way before you felt the strain from those few extra ounces.8. Same old dorky front camera: even though the rare camera has been upgraded the most functional camera of the iPad, the front camera, has been ignored. I completely fail to understand the logic behind this idea.9. Lack of Siri: most people were expecting to receive this iPhone 4S feature in their new iPad. But all they got was disappointment. Some people think that apple might have intentionally saved Siri for their next launch. However, apple has added a brand new feature to the new ipad, the dictation, and it may offset the disappointment to some extent. It is noteworthy to mention that both Siri and dictation need Internet connectivity to function.With this basic information about the new iPad it will now be easier for me to recommend the edition of the iPad that will suit your needs.So who should buy the new iPad?The biggest and perhaps the only visible plus of the new iPad thus far seems to be its display. All other features are more or less subdued by its lack of basic luxuries. For instance, the higher RAM feature is neutralized by the higher demand for memory, so on and so forth.So, if you are a digital photographer, the new iPad is the tablet of choice for you. No other display will give you even the closest visualization of the pixels that you captured.if you are a low to medium level surfer and like to read books and magazines with colorful graphics and display, the 3rd generation is the way to go.Game lovers who have extremely sensitive senses for sensing the speed, the new iPad is your gadget.If you are a big fan of shooting pictures and videos with your tablet (which is kind of odd, though), the new iPad is your tool. But you have to give me a genuinely convincing reason for choosing a tablet over a digital camera or even an iPhone to shoot quality photos and videos.Beyond this I would seriously recommend to meticulously outweigh risks verses benefits of buying the 3rd over 2nd generation iPad.And, who should buy the iPad 2? Well, everybody else who does not meet the above criterion. If you are an aggressive tablet user and must hold it for an infinite number of hours without having to bear the discomfort due to its higher temperature or weight or strain to your `retina', you are an born to use iPad 2.For intense ipad users a sluggish charge time is definitely going to be a deal breaker when purchasing the new iPad. Additionally, the fact that the new iPad's battery does not charge when it is plugged and simultaneously running some 'heavy' apps will add to its disability.For Navigation lovers, iPad 2 will certainly have an edge because of its quick charge time while you are on the go.People who live in wifi unfriendly homes should think twice before buying the new iPad.iPad 2 is light on your pocket if you are a big time GSM user. Since there are no unlimited data plans for iPad so one must use the data prudently to avoid being billed multiple times in a month. Both Verizon and AT&T; offer no more than 5 GB of data per charge for iPad. Here again the classification of aggressive vs low to medium user should help you decide between iPad 2 and the new iPad.If you are low on budget you could save a some money by choosing iPad 2. This is not only because of the recent price slash of iPad 2 but also due to the fact that the new iPad's higher memory requirement has only left you with the choice of purchasing its pricier version that has more memory.if you are a big time video chatter buying the new iPad will not make your experience any better than ipad 2 since no change has been made to the front camera of the tablet. Second, if you are chatting on a GSM plan you will now be burning more Mb/minute that you would with the previous version.Conclusion: Consider the New iPad if you are a big time digital photographer (professional or hobbyist) and if you are a low to medium tablet user. For everybody else, there is iPad 2.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .The post-purchase review:I did eventually end up buying the new ipad. I took a chance and bought the least expensive third generation. I placed an order on the apple website and the item was shipped straight from China. The neat thing about this deal was the free personalized text engraving. I wrote 'Made for ...our names' and added my address to it as well.So, what is the deal with the New iPad? Well, to be honest, the heating issue was barely discernable but I really did not hag it to the limits so I am probably not the best person to pass the final verdict on the heating issue. But the real issue here was the display. Yes, 'issue'. I was quite disappointed to see how the pictures on various Internet sites appeared on the new ipad. Most of the facebook avatars appear fuzzy and ugly. People say that this effect is similar to the one we noticed when HD cameras first became available. They would magnify even the slightest wrinkle on your face and make you look darn ugly. But I am not the expert here, all I can say is I prefer my ipad 2 over the new ipad for facebook and picture surfing. Another important mention that I would like to make is about YouTube videos. Contrary to what one (me included) would have expected the new ipad is no better than ipad 2 in displaying even the highest resolution videos on YouTube. Infact the colors appear slightly distorted as compared to more natural looking ones on ipad 2. The new ipad does however have a slight edge over the ipad 2 when it comes to displaying high resolution pictures downloaded straight from high pixil DSLR camera.The next thing that I would definitely like to mention about the new ipad is its dictation feature. I must say that this is a great achievement. The transcription is more accurate than most other dictation apps. The best part is that this feature is integrated in to the keyboard so you do not have to open a seperate app to use it. You can use it almost anywhere where the keyboard pops up. But the question really is how many people will actually use this feature to make it a must-have option, I would say, not too many.I did not come across any issue with wifi connectivity. And, the thickness and heaviness was completely beyond my perception levels. With your eyes closed you can barely tell whether you are holding an ipad 2 or the new ipad. It even fit into the tragus leather case that is made for ipad 2 without ANY problems.And now I am sure most of you would like to ask me whether my opinion about the new ipad changed after I purchased it. My answer would be NO. I still think that all the 'yummy' features that the new ipad has been stuffed with are 'optional' and do not justify the release of a brand new version. People could have comfortably lived with the iPad 2 for another 2-3 years.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Content: I wish I could return - almost useless! I bought the Ipad3 as it seemed like it would be convenient to view movies from my movie collections.  Was I wrong!  You need to be a rocket scientist to figure it out.  I-Tunes does a horrible job of allowing any personal movies (which i own!), to go on the IPad.  After frustrating HOURS of messing with it and putting it off (untill refund options did run out), I feel completely ripped off.  I could have bought other devices that could have allowed me this absolutely key feature to work.I will not recommend this device to any of my friends and let them know the complete disappointment I have experienced with it.  Why else would you buy a big screen if it doesn't let you watch what you want?  Get iphone instead - or better yet, jump ship in the I-crap.

Content: Over priced, but serviceable, I purchased this along with thousands of others at the time we purchased it blindly because it was cool and we wanted the hype the problem is that on this unit Apple has limited a lot of the abilities of mobile computing. For example the Blue tooth Stack has been severely limited, there is no usb port, no memory card slot, its a great kids toy but for a serious user, avoid it, again good for kids bad for just about everything else.

Content: My first iPad. I have owned iPhones for a few years now, and this is my first iPad. I love it! My only complaint is the typing-- iPhones and I guess iPads too don't like my fingers too much but I may purchase an external keyboard soon.  It is fast, has Siri (with the newest software update), excellent voice recognition, excellent camera, etc. I have been playing around with the included photo booth and the iPad3 is by far my newest and most fun toy!

Content: Stunning display. Fast LTE. Good battery life. I upgraded after owning an iPad 2 16GB Wifi + 3G. The screen alone was worth it. Being able to fit 4x as much information on the screen is fantastic. Text remains sharp even when very small. SpeedTest on LTE from AT&T; topped out at 27 Mbps down and 14 Mbps up. Wish the data plans weren't so stingy, because at this rate you can blow through your month's allotment of 2GB in 10 minutes of downloading... but that's really AT&T;'s fault, not Apple's.Usability is second to none. I'm a pure Windows guy and even I concede defeat here. The iPad is intuitive and easy to use. It's also very responsive. Snappy when it switches back and forth between apps. Pinch/zoom and flipping motions are fluid. Android tablets are getting better all the time, but the iPad is still king here.Battery life is pretty good. With light use, I charge it probably every 2-3 days.With more apps being updated to take advantage of the high resolution display, I find more and more of my storage space being stealthily consumed. With 75 apps, 100 songs, 3 videos, and about 150 pictures, my 16GB iPad has about 5GB of free storage. If you're someone who feels the need to carry more of your music or video collection with you, you'll probably want the 32GB version.The iPad is locked down, so you're limited to the Apple-approved apps you can install through the App Store. This has always been a curse and a blessing. The experience is refined, but power users can feel confined. You can always jailbreak it, though at the expense of your warranty.The worst part about the iPad is having to use iTunes. It's got an outdated feel. It poorly manages media folders. It's a memory hog. It's got limited support for music formats. It stealthily tries to install Safari and QuickTime at every update. Wouldn't put up with it if I wasn't stuck with it.

Content: Who's Ipad is it???? I ordered my Ipad on July 25th of 2012. I received it shortly thereafter. A few weeks later I called Verizon for a data plan which they did provide. When the first bill came from Verizon there was a $904.13 equipment charge. After several calls and many hours on the phone Verizon tells me the serial number of the Ipad I bought from Tech Giant, fulfilled by Amazon is (wait for it...) STOLEN. I offer to provide Verizon with my proof of purchase from Amazon and Verizon says it doesn't matter. Verizon says I bought a stolen Ipad so I am responsible to Verizon for payment (904.13) after I have already paid Amazon $864.00 for the Ipad. I contacted Amazon about it and all they say is they are sorry and let them know if they can be of further assistance. HELLO I contacted you for assistance. Did you help me when I wasn't looking? Sounds like Tech Giant owes Verizon some money. Needless to say I am about as ticked off as one can be.

I love my iPad!! only thing that bugged me is that I had to get it exchanged 4 times because there was always a defect with it, first one the screen was extremly yellow, second one had a line going through the screen, 3rd one the screen was yellow again, and then the 4 one had dead pixels, then the 5th ipad I got was perfect!!, I dont mind exchanging my apple products out for replacements but I think they should have better quality control. other then that I love my iPad, its the best, nothing can beat an iPad.

Content: Poor wi fi performance and customer service. My IPAD 3 wi fi constantly slows down or loses connectivity after fifteen minutes in public wi fi spots. It does well at home.  In hotspots it's unusable.  I went twice to the apple store and a genius did a reset of wi fi networks, went out to test, no better, returned and requested an exchange as its still under warranty. The manager said their "process"requires a total system reset first.  So they reset it and I had to leave.  Still no good.Contrast this with customer service with Verizon where I had a defective earphone jack on a droid phone.  They took my word for it, shipped a new phone out immediately and a container to return the old phone.  You bet I will stay with them.My next tablet will be an Android.  Apple no longer has a monopoly on tablets which seems to elude them.A also have a Kindle Fire HD which is great.  I will have to make a third trip to the Apple store which is not convenient.After my third trip to the Apple store, they honored the warranty and gave me a new and working iPad 3.  I must say, the apps for the iPad work very well  give it an edge for now.

Content: Black 32GB iPad, Wi-Fi + At&T; 4G. I purchased my iPad 3rd Gen last year in July and I haven't had a problem with it ever since. I would recommend buying your iPad here. I bought mine for $700+ and I saw that it's for $500+ now. Wow! That's really a great deal! Of course with high tech gadgets, when you wait a year or so the price decreases dramatically. Who waits that long to buy a new toy to play with? It's still cheaper than buying it on apple.com though.

Content: This Apple IPad is terrific.  An exciting, new experience for me.  Great buy and seller. New experience for me, and I am thrilled with the purchase.  Well packaged, excellent condition, good communication.At first, I was confused by the scratches on it, but I had to learn that it was not the actual face of the IPod but the cover protector that I was judging.  The seller told me that the protection could be removed or I could buy a new protector for only $1 if that was my choice.  I would highly encourage anyone who buys from this seller to be totally satisfied.

Content: not the best choice for students. I bought my iPad to integrate with the way my courses are becoming more and more digital, but to be honest, I was expecting a little more for my money. First and, for me, foremost, ebooks aren't easy to access: there's no way to store them on the device and instead, my purchases had to be viewed online. Which wouldn't be so bad, if all the web was ipad-compatible.For popular and cutting-edge websites, the iPad works like a dream. But any site that doesn't have a team of programmers, (or better yet, an app) can be rather touch and go. I just wasn't able to log onto my university email, for instance. I spent time finding elaborate solutions to problems that just don't exist for a laptop.At the end of the day, I must say that the iPad is a great product for light work, like networking, googling, or just killing time. But don't depend on it as your primary computer: if you have something that needs to be done once, and done right, go back to your desk and switch on old reliable.

It is fast, and it arrived in very good condition, no scratches, no evidence of misuse at all. It did have the previous user's Facebook account stuff still on it. I had to take all that stuff off, and it had several updates that were under her name and password. I had to call Apple tech support to get those removed. Other than that, I couldn't be any happier with this iPad.

Content: Hate it. I absolutely hate it. It's basic architecture is such that apps can't communicate productively with each other. As a result, every app has to duplicate computer-like sharing functions that would be trivial in a real computer. Most of the time, they do a miserable job of it. The screen is the best touch screen, so I've read, but that isn't saying much. You often have to keep whacking away at the screen to get it to respond and often the response is for the icon next to the one you're whacking. The whole touch screen user interface is remarkable, but it's very limited. It's simply impossible to make a screen icon or label for even the limited number of actions you can take; the actions for which there's no label/icon are basically secret. You may stumble over them, you may not. You certainly will never have the functionality of a real computer.In spite of all the problems of the iPad and its imitators, many people buy them. If you limit yourself to simple email handling, on the level of what we had 30+ years ago before the web, taking pictures, and browsing web sites while not using them to do much, I suppose the iPad is a decent enough choice. But don't buy a new one. The used ones are half the price and they're in terrific condition.

Content: Too Heavy and Hot!! Text is Stunning on New Display!!! I own both the ipad 2 and ipad 3. I'm just going to give a quick overview of the ipad 3 vs the ipad 2.iPad 3 Advantages:  Clearer graphic and stunning text, much better camera and video recordingiPad 3 The Bads:  Way heavier compare to the ipad 2, a lot warmer in temperature, takes a lot longer to charge, speed is not faster like advertised,  Video Quality is not better (Screen makes videos worse)After owning both, I would not recommend iPad 2 owners to upgrade to the new ipad, unless you like reading a lot. The text on the new ipad is incredible. I love reading on the new ipad.Update 5/31/12:  Charging time is a pain.  It takes way too long to charge.  Beware if you use the ipad a lot.  For people that don't use it too much then I don't see any problems.  Come back to the display,  I was using my friend's ipad 2 the other day and I can't take the fuzzy words and pixels that I see.

Content: Horrible Device For Basic Business Needs!  Too many restrictions! I've had my new iPad for a couple weeks now & I am constantly having road blocks doing basic everyday functions.  Don't be fooled by the slick design & nice screen display, this device has so many limitations compared to other cheaper devices.I think it's good for an entertainment device but it's horrible for business. Here's why....The iPad does not allow a basic way to attach a file to an email.The iPad does not allow a way to upload any content through a web browser. Example, if you wanted to upload your current resume to a career site, there is no way for iPad to do so.  You would have to use your computer or an android device.I'm shocked in 2012 with a hi tech device I'm unable to do the most basic everyday functions.I tested out some cheaper android tablets & they all seem to do the basic internet functions with no problem; even the Kindle Fire!?. Email attachment, upload & download files through the web browser.  All web content is not hosted through iTunes so the restrictions is a big headache.  If you do any business through email & web browsers, do not travel without a laptop.

Content: Look What It Did To Me!!!!!!!!!! This  Ipad was amazing because as soon as I bought I thought it would be great... It turned about that I was wrong. I let my baby use it and it broke. As soon as I told my wife she went into to cardiac arrest and my baby turned into a werewolf. I was soon over taken by the zombies that made a cult in my basement. The whole city of Southboro was OVERTAKEN AND I HAD TO MOVE. In recap the Ipad made me lose my wife my baby and my house (Not to mention the city of Southboro).

Content: The best investment yet... If you wish to invest in a laptop, try the ipad first. It can serve most of your needs and give you the reliability that you need for computing.Pros: magnificent design gives your projects streamlined timeliness and easability. PC owners will be converted with the beautiful imagery and beauty of this device. Extend your workspace with bluetooth products like the Apple keyboard which will help quicken the pace of word processing.Cons: may not have the power of a MacBook. MacBooks have better processors since they are expected to handlel more information at once. Also, a disappointing inability to interpret Adobe Flash Player restricts viewing of some interfaces; however, more updates and inventions make this problem tiny.I am a graphic designer and use many Apps for iPad out there. Try ArtStudio. It's the Pixelmator for iPads. Truly stunning capabilities.

Content: Still the best tablet 3 years later. My iPad 2 started to have memory issues when running more than one app or many browser tabs at the same time. I was hoping to use my iPad 2 for 2 years and get the iPad 4. I decided to try the newest android tablet the Samsung note 10.1. I experienced many issues on it and in the end I missed the usability, reliability and apps of my iPad 2. I decided to get the iPad 3 and am very happy with it so far. It is more expensive and has less features than the Samsung note 10.  But it is still the best tablet on the market hands down. The iPad is really easy to use, has a huge app market for tablets, good support, good build quality, lots of accessories, retina display and air play.  When I first read about the iPad 3's retina display I thought it was a gimmick. After owning and using it I do see the difference with the screen. Since I spend a huge amount of time on my iPad 3 (mostly reading) it makes sense to get a better screen. They say it's suppose to be better on your eyes even if you have bad eye sleight. I also see the difference when watching videos or viewing pictures. In terms of speed I don't really notice the difference from my iPad 2. The extra ram is probably the main thing I've benefited from by getting the iPad 3. I do wish apple would improve the speakers on the iPad by making them stereo and not down facing. That's once thing I miss from the Samsung note 10. The samsung note 10 also had the ability to do real multitasking not the seudo stuff apple does. The note 10 could also run apps simultaneously side by side. These are things apple could do to improve their tablet even more. Although the iPad 3 is only slightly heavier and thicker than the iPad 2, I still notice the difference. I know that apple had to put a larger battery to power the higher resolution screen, LTE and processor.  I just think its unlike apple to release a product that is heavier, thicker and offers less battery life than it's predecessor. I haven't updated to iOS 6 yet as I heard it slows down the device, gets rid of YouTube/google maps and wifi issues. I am waiting for an update and also a jailbreak for ios 6. I am looking forward to Siri for the iPad 3, browser enhancements, email enhancements and Facebook integration. In the end apple won me over with air play since I own 2 apple tv 2's. No other tablet or mobile device anything like air play or as easy to use as AirPlay.Early November 2012 update: Well Apple screwed us iPad 3 owners by releasing a new iPad just 6 months after this one. The iPad 4 has a faster A6X chip, dual channel bonding wifi, a hd front camera and lightning connector. The new chip is suppose to make the iPad 4 twice as fast as the iPad 3. The dual channel bonding will make wifi connectivity twice as fast when connected to a n network support router. The lightning connector is suppose to charge the ipad 4 about 45 minutes quicker than the previous version. Personally I wanted an iPad that was thinner, lighter, had more ram and stereo speakers. Do yourself a favor dont buy the Ipad 4. Wait for the iPAd 5 which will most probably be thinner, lighter, stereo speakers and more ram and look like the ipad mini. In my case I was within 3 weeks. The apple store let me return mine for a full refund. I came home and placed an order for a iPad 3 refurb. I got my refurb wifi 64gb for only $550. Which is a great deal. I really dont know why Apple couldnt have waited a few more months for a newer version. Who knows maybe Apple will release a new iPAd in march or april again. The only reason to get an ipad 4 is if you do alot of gaming, photo editing or video editing otherwise your not really going to notice the difference or be worth your while. Save your money and get the ipad 3 refurb or just wait until the ipad 5.

Content: Exceeds Expectations. I purchased this iPad for my wife, her first pad-style system.  She had had an HP laptop, and was never very happy with it.  The iPad is amazing, and I also purchased a case with an optional keyboard, but she actually prefers the screen keyboard.  To say she is happy with the iPad is an understatement.  She loves it!  And being an Apple product, everything is better than advertised.  She loves the graphics, and is already Skyping with her brother.  So we could not be happier with the product.

Content: Ones upon a time. I always wanted a iPad but fell in love with the kindle fire hd so much I bought two one 7 inch and 1 8.9 .They were pure entertainment devices and very family friendly but they did have there limitations.My work required me to have access to apps that the fire didn't  have  increasing my need for a full tablet experience with that said I did keep my 7 inch fire hd.I love hd entertainment and the iPad didn't disappoint me at all yes I did pay more for the iPad for the extras I needed but its the real deal if you have the luxury of having a fire hd 7 inch and a 10 inch iPad do it because the I pad mini is not a fire hd.Now that I told you my story I have to say the iPad retina has been with me every where I go my tablet is no longer my bedtime device it's a part of my life and yes it does everything it should do well movies ,music ,apps and more and it does it very well .I believe that until someone makes a device that is easy to use and is main stream the 9.7 inch iPad will remain the best tablet on the marketEveryone competes and compares there tablet with the iPad the reason is  they have to its that good but most important you need a tablet in today's world .As a Amazon customer I didn't want to write this review but respectfully I will say if you want a pure entertainment device the 8.9 fire hd is a excellent tablet for half the money and it was totally out of need that I spent the extra money for the iPad and you will have to buy a iPad to even be close to a amazon product or buy both .My only regret was I had to buy a used open box item described as like new and it was like very used in fair and dirty condition the power cord was crazy dirty the tablet had the dirtiest box and finger prints all over the glass it did clean up well but it was only $10.00 less then the same one new at apples online store with a one year warranty but I only found that out after I bought it .Service with amazon is one of the best online and maybe I got the wrong iPad because they sell good,very good, and like new and anything I ever bought like new was either new or real close  who knows maybe after this review they may offer me a new one .Remember the iPad is a great tablet there is no way you won't like it but for the small difference maybe you should buy new and get the real experience .It's like staying in the best hotel and getting a bad room .I plan to give a update so stay tune.

Content: Changes the way you do everything! I've had my 3rd generation iPad for a little over a year now. This device joins my very first iPod and Kindle on my "Why didn't I buy this sooner?" list.When the iPad first came out, I knew I wanted one. I didn't know what I would use it for, I just knew that I wanted it. I loved my iPhone so why wouldn't I like this?I had no idea. The iPad changed everything. I am still amazed by all of the things I can do with it. Here the list of how I use my iPad on a daily basis:* Email - Obviously. I use it for both work and personal email, especially at home after work.* Web browsing - Naturally. The Safari browser (as well as the Google Chrome app) work great. As long as there is no Flash, it's as good as or better than using a computer.* Reading - The Kindle app looks amazing on the Retina screen. Plus, since I can sync what I'm reading between this, my iPhone, and my actual Kindle, it doesn't matter which device I have with me, I can always pick up exactly where I left off.* Magazines - I never read a ton of magazines before, but now the only ones I do read are in the Newsstand app. Just like with books, I've gone paperless here.* Comics - I'm not a huge comic fan, but there are many titles that I do like to read. The key there is "read." I don't need to collect them anymore. They just take up too much space. I just want to read them and move on. Now that all of the major publishers have excellent digital versions of the comics (most released the same day as print) it was a no-brainer to go digital here. As soon as I got my iPad, I stopped buying paper comics and have been 100% digital ever since. That has also saved me money. Most digital comics are cheaper than print (some the day they are released, some a few weeks later). I'm usually so far behind in my reading that the price has dropped by the time I'm ready to buy the next issue. In just one year, I have saved almost half the cost of the iPad by waiting for comic prices to drop before I purchase. I can carry 100s of comics with me at any time. This is the future of the comic book industry.* Movies & TV shows - With Netflix and Amazon Prime, I can stream an endless number of TV shows and movies. Combine that with my own digital library of shows and movies and I never have a shortage of something to watch, no matter where I am. The best accessory for my iPad to watch movies is my hammock in the back yard. Can't be beat.* Sports - I'm a baseball fan so I use the MLB At Bat app to watch games of my favorite teams. (subscription required). The Watch ESPN app is great also.* Social media - Facebook, Twitter, etc. In many cases, their apps are better than the user interface you get in a web browser.* Shopping - The Amazon and eBay apps are way better than their standard web interface. The last few times I've sold something on eBay, I created the listing 100% on the iPad (including the photo).* Games - Everything from basic puzzle games, to social games, to platform-quality action games can be played on the iPad. I used to play more video games (consoles, PC, etc.) but don't have as much time for it anymore. Now if I have 10-15 minutes free, I can jump in and play some Modern Combat 4 no matter where I am.* Notes - Almost three years ago, I decided to go paperless with my notes at work. My handwriting was horrible and I can type faster than I write. I started using Evernote and haven't looked back (actually, I'm typing this in Evernote). I've learned that I can type pretty quickly on the iPad keyboard so that is all I take to meetings these days and I have access to all of my notes.* Connecting with friends/family - With Facetime and Skype, it's easier than ever to fire up a video chat.* Remote desktop - There are several apps that allow you to log in and remotely control your PC/Mac from the iPad. This means that you don't have to carry all of that with you.* All the rest... - Dropbox for file sharing. Countless games and TV shows for kids. Online banking. Pandora for some music (combined with a Jambox you get a lot of music and great sound). The list goes on.So there you go. If you aren't sure what you'd actually use an iPad for, hopefully this will help you see the potential. I used to sit with my laptop on my lap when hanging out at home. Now I keep the iPad around and can grab it quickly and easily to do just about anything I need.

Content: It's a Tablet, a Big Battery Wireless Hotspot, a GPS, a XHD TV, a Portal, a Windows 8 Tablet! How did the lowly tablet come to steamroll the PC market? By it's overwhelming usability. I'm so impressed by the versatility of the New iPad 4G Verizon LTE. I thought I would only use it to consume media. It does that and much more. In the first few days of ownership, I've used it as a portal into the world. I find it more comfortable than a PC to read Wikipedia, see amazing photos, and watch instructional videos. The display is the first mobile device to use XHD resolution -- much higher resolution and better fidelity than today's desktop monitors. When I travel, I no longer have to pack a wireless router, GPS (via cellular radio), Kindle, iPod, extra rechargers or cables. The iPad becomes a big battery WiFi hotspot via its cellular modem. I've loaded Windows 8 Consumer Preview on several notebooks. With the use of SplashTop server and iPad app called "Win8 Metro Testbed", I'm able to use the iPad as a Windows 8 tablet. Works well. This one device has both simplified and amplified my life. The device's primary negative is some screen glare and complete washout in bright sunlight. eInk is much superior in that environment.Update 17-Apr-2012: In Paris, both my New iPad and iPhone are working with Free.fr SIM cards. Free.fr's SIM is 20 Euros per month, prepaid, and includes 3GB data usage. If the device has a phone (iPhone) it includes unlimited voice and SMS. The iPhone needs no special settings. iPhone and iPad both work with Personal Hotspots feature on free.fr. For data use, the iPad requires an APN setting of "free" in Cellular Data settings, and again in Personal Hotspot if that feature is desired. Free.fr uses the Orange.fr 3G network -- France's largest. Using Speedtest.net, I usually get > 1Mbps download speeds and as high as 10Mbps sometimes. Data usage requires 3G which is ubiquitous in Paris but voice works fine on 2G (usually found in Metros).

Content: 3 Generations in and Still No Equal. Pros: Slimmer design; 4G & Wi-Fi; personal hotspot; beautiful screenCons: Still no usable USB portsBottom-Line: like the iPad 1 and 2 before it the iPad 3 is the must have device of the decade, period! The tablet has become and extension of my arm!My Apple iPad.  What started out as a nice to have toy, has become the virtually indispensable tool for making sense of my increasingly hectic life.  There isn't a day that goes by when I am not on the device; from checking my e-mail, to sending and receiving text messages; from checking my calendar to playing games with friends and family; from posting to Facebook or Twitter to listening to NPR's morning edition; reading the latest news from the AP, New York Times, Politico, NPR, or The Daily, to listening to music on-line or stored on my hard drive; from logging into my business network via VPN, to talking to me daughter via FaceTime, almost everything I need to get done on my laptop I can now do on my iPad.Now Apple has released the iPad 3 and those of us who use the iPad 2 are throwing them over for the next big, or should I say smaller thing.  I was satisfied with the iPad 2, but never wanting to be behind the technology curve I decided to order the newest offering from Apple in the exact same configuration as the last; in other words I ordered an "iPad 64GB Wi-Fi+4G" version.The iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G FactsOn the surface the iPad 3 is not demonstratively different from the iPad 2.  Featuring an Apple designed Dual-core A5X, low power, high performance processor, the 1.44 pound (1.46 pounds for the Wi-Fi + 4G) iPad 3 is a tad thinner than the iPad 2, though the screen size stays the same.  Other than that, there are no physical changes to the tablet.  Under the skin however, Apple has included a Retina display that offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch.  The other notable change concerns the front and rear facing cameras, which now offer 5MP autofocus resolution and HD video recording.No matter what hardware version (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi + 4G, 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB) you chose the Ultra-Portable, iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a simple device with very few moving parts.  The power button sits on the top of the device on the right, while a standard 3.5mm headphone jack is situated on the far left.  Along the right edge of the 0.37" thick iPad you'll find the screen lock/mute and volume control switches, while the bottom of the 9.56" long device is reserved for speakers and the USB/power port.  The USB port is proprietary so, no, like the iPad Original you cannot plug a USB memory stick into it, but with the provided cord you can plug it into your computer and into an outlet to recharge the device.The iPad 3 (available in black and white body styles) can be had with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of memory, and all iterations are fitted with a 1GHz Apple A5 custom-designed, high performance, low-power processor.  Internet connectivity is through either Wi-Fi (802.11a/b/g/n), and or 4G LTE: UMTS/HSDPA/HSPA+/DC -HSDPA (850, 900, 1900, 2100 MHz) and GSM/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz).  Bluetooth 2.1 EDR is also provided with either configuration.The 9.7-inch fingerprint resistant LED-backlit glossy widescreen multi-touch color display offers 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution @ 264 pixels per inch and can display multiple languages and characters simultaneously.  The IPad 3 is fitted with an ambient light sensor and the device supports 576p and 480p with Apple Component AV Cable; 576i and 480i with Apple Composite AV Cable and 1024x 768 with Dock Connector to VGA adapter.The back camera can be used for HD (1080p) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera with 5x zoom.  The front camera can also be used for (VGA) video recording of up to 30 frames per second with audio, as well as still camera pictures.Re-syncing with iTunes or iCloudThe iPad 3 will sync up whatever Apps, music, Podcasts, movies, etc., connected/ associated with your iTunes account and currently on your iTunes desktop.  I was able to sync the iPad 3 to iTunes and like magic everything that was on my iPad 2 showed up on my iPad 3, since the last time I "physically" backed up the tablet via iTunes, right before I started using iCloud to perform back-ups.So I finished the restore via iCloud which took close to three hours to complete.  No big deal; I plugged the tablet into A/C, started the restore and went to bed. I did restore all of my music (15GB) via iTunes however, and that took considerably longer than 3 hours to accomplish; again another overnight chore.  I suppose if I purchase more iCloud storage I could back up everything including my music, but I see no need to pay for additional storage; 10GB would set me back $20.00 a year; 20GB = $40.00/year, and; 50GB = $100.00/year.Microsoft ActiveSyncSurprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, setting up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use Microsoft Exchange via Exchange ActiveSync is simple and easy; all told it took less the two minute to start receiving my business e-mail on the device, and there does not seem to be a limit to the number of devices associated with a given ActiveSync account; I also have my iPhone 4S and iPod 3rd Generation synced.After I established the connection via ActiveSync I verified inbox functionality by reading, responding to, forwarding, and moving, e-mail.  iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G even allows you to choose whether or not you want to download your business contacts and calendar; sweet!And once connected I am able to control password usage, minimum and maximum length, age, complexity, and expiration via an Exchange ActiveSync policy.  The policy can also control other aspect of the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G's including third-party e-mail account creation; Windows SharePoint Services and Windows File Shares access; message size limits; attachment downloading, as well as a host of other security related features and functions.Word to the wise: Exchange ActiveSync policies, limited as they can be configured to disable a number of features on the device including camera, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.  And yes, utilizing ActiveSync I can even wipe the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G from the Exchange server, and as long as the tablet remains a part of the ActiveSync policy it will continue to wipe every time its powered on unless it is either removed from the policy or the check mark is removed from the radio button instructing ActiveSync to "Perform a remote wipe to clear mobile device data."VPN AccessThe iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has VPN access and it actually work quite well.  There are three options: L2TP, PPTP, or Cisco IPSEC. Like Exchange ActiveSync the VPN functionality was surprisingly easy to set up and get going, all one needs to know is what information to plug in and away we go!VPN took less than a minute to set up and configure, and once complete I was able to log into my company Intranet and thanks to some (free) Apps I was able to RDP into my workstation from the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G; again, sweet!  Yes, the lack of makes maneuvering around the desktop somewhat challenging, but I could still get around the desktop and use it.  Note: there are paid versions of the Apps I used that offer crude mouse functionality.Like all of the network components on iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G VPN can be togged on and off at will.Personal HotspotNew to the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is the Personal Hotspot, which allows you to share the tablets' cellular data connection in order to connect computers and other devices to the Internet.  Nice!!!First ImpressionsLike the iPad's that have come before it, I really, really, really, like the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G.  Naysayers aside this thing is cool and I am happy to own one and even take it out in public!  I love being able to take my favorite book(s) with me when I am on the go, and I have the ability to stop at a Wi-Fi hotspot and plugging into the Internet in order to read the latest news, get the weather, run an application, play a game, post to social networks, log into my business network and access my workstation, read e-mail, etc.But, I really like the fact that I can take the lightweight iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G with me everywhere and still gain access to my pre-selected books, magazines, music and images, not to mention a seemingly endless supply of useful applications.  And let's not forget the Internet and business as well as personal e-mail.Today while typing out this review on my iMac, I fired up my iPad 3 and I played Hanging with Friends with an old friend in Maryland, held a text conversation with a friend visiting Vegas and another in downstate Illinois, read e-mails from 3 separate accounts, posted to Facebook & Twitter, while listening to music via Pandora! Last night while grilling BBQ chicken on the patio I streamed music from my iPad to a portable Bose speaker via Bluetooth!Setting up Wi-Fi is easy enough; the antenna is always on and looking for new connection.  I set up the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G to use the secure wireless setup at work; I typed in the pass-phrase via the incredibly handy keyboard and surfed the Internet; simple and easy.  Since I started using the iPad I have taken it out frequently to places that offer free Wi-Fi access and in only one instance did I have an issue connecting.  Nice!  And even then I effortlessly switched to 4G and, instance access.Heat & NoiseThere has been much to do about the heat the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G gives off, and while I have noted that the tablet gets a little warmer than its predecessor, the degree of change is in no way uncomfortable.  So, I have to ask what all the fuss is about!?ConclusionsI like the iPad; it is the must have device of the decade, period for anyone who wants to stay connected!  Not a day goes by when I do not use it for something.  I love the portability of the device, the ease of use, the utilitarian nature of the unit, thanks in large part to the plethora of Apps that can be down loaded and utilized for the tablet.Is the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G ready for the enterprise?  I say yes with a few caveats; chief among them is the inability of the tablet to truly manipulate Microsoft Office Applications without the assistance of the Documents-to-Go application ($9.99), or an increasing number of similar applications.  Second is the inability to truly mirror the iPad screen on a monitor, however with the Apple Digital AV Adapter that can be changed.  Video can be presented onto the screen--via an HDMI connection.Lastly, is the lack of available USB port(s) or a memory card reader that will accept memory devices and help you keep files organized on-the-go, as well as the ability to truly turn the iPad into a mobile office, though again via Apps that is changing.  For instance I purchased an App last week that allows me to access our Microsoft SharePoint 2007 environment and manipulate documents contained in Lists and Document Libraries.  This is a big deal as more and more business content is shared and or stored on SharePoint in a number of businesses.  The availability of VPN on the iPad makes this possible.There are also a number of very good RDP applications available in the App Store that will allow me to log into my workstation at the office and manipulate date via VPN. As the number of Apps that mimic , and or reproduce the business environment increase so too with the iPad's usefulness as a business tool!Hands down, the Apple iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G is a performance winner, and one heck of an e-book reader! The new Retina display has made considerable difference in the reading of text on the tablet.  Whereas before my eyes would start to hurt after just 15 minutes of book reading on the older iPads, not I can read continually without discomfort, the text acuity has improved that much!Yes, the entrance fee ($829.00 for iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G) is steep, and enterprise customers will have to think long and hard at the cost, however the iPad now has a certain "cool" factor that is hard to escape.  The more large enterprises adapt the iPad and find practical uses for it, the more popular it will become in the hall of corporate America.So far the iPad 3 64GB Wi-Fi +4G has more than lived up to my expectations and I have fun testing the limits of its ability to operate effectively in the enterprise and personal environments.

Content: Over priced, but serviceable, I purchased this along with thousands of others at the time we purchased it blindly because it was cool and we wanted the hype the problem is that on this unit Apple has limited a lot of the abilities of mobile computing. For example the Blue tooth Stack has been severely limited, there is no usb port, no memory card slot, its a great kids toy but for a serious user, avoid it, again good for kids bad for just about everything else.

Content: Great at what it is intended to do. If you like reading books, watching TV shows or Movies, and playing games, then this device is perfect. However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about. I've rarely had difficulty finding a hot spot at any destination I've travelled to.

Content: Rocks My Socks! It is the best thing since sliced bread!  Love my iPad.  The whole family uses it.  Kids read books on it which is a great way to get them into reading more, especially considering the books can be very interactive.  Great for quickly looking stuff up with out busting out a bulky lap top.  Games, movies, apps...seriously really fun!  When the iPad 1st came out, I thought I really wouldn't buy one because it's just like the iPhone, but having that big screen for certain things is really great!

Content: Great upgrade from old version. I've had every iPad that came out and this one is awesome. I had the iPad 3rd generation wifi only for a while and I was needing to use data on my train rides and decided to get a new iPad. Settling for a iPad LTE carrier was easy for me. I chose AT&T; because I already have the iPhone 5 under that carrier. The speed is amazing and I love it!

Content: Cracked screen after 3 weeks of minimal use without any form of abuse to the product. Within 3 weeks of moderate use (and handling with carefulness) the screen cracked and shattered at the top where you turn on and off.  This was not dropped or abused in any way.  Thankfully Amazon stood behind this purchase.  Again, this cracked with out dropage or any misuse.  I don't believe this was at the fault in any way of the shipper, but after further research appears to be an Apple issue.

Content: My first iPad. I kept myself away from 1st and the 2nd gen iPad for past 3 years. I thought having a windows tablet would make lot of sense to me. But after 3 years still there are no windows tablet and windows 8 is planed to be released by end of 2012. And there will be host of tablet makers good/bad/ugly onces in the market and trying to find the best one is difficult. So that means another 1.5 years of wait.Meanwhile, about 8 months back I purchased asus transformer 1st gen. It kept me happy for sometime, but latter I was less than happy with its performance. With the death of asus transformer tablet that I own, it was no brainer to buy the 3rd gen iPad.The iPad does what it is advertised to do, it is a giant iPod touch, but the larger screen is always better.The tablet is all nice and good, the apps, the performance the acceleration, the retina display etc.BUT the display calibration is bad. I have iPhone 4 and now iPad 3. iPhone 4 has much better color reproduction quality than iPad. The white on iPad looks pale white instead of pleasant white on iPhone.If the display is not able to reproduce the white properly then there is no way (IMO) it will be able to reproduce other colors properly.I have attached an image showing the difference between iPhone 4 and iPad3 display.EDIT1: I am doing a battery cycle test, i.e. charge to the maximum, discharge till it shuts off. Then recharge back to 100%. It took about 6-7 hrs to discharge the battery completely mostly reading books and surfing and few 1-2 min youtube video.And it is taken me 6 hrs to charge from 20% to 85%, I did not track when I put it charge at 0% so it has actually taken much longer to come to 85%. It is not a good deal with the batter, right? The battery discharges way faster than recharging. I am using the adapter and cable provided by the iPad 3. The battery recharging capability is less than satisfactory to me.Edit2: I upped my rating by one star because I am more than happy with the performance of the device.  How fast I can type compared to the android device I had and many apps that are polished for good experience.

Content: It all depends on how you'll be using this device. From an Android based perspective, this device will get a 4-star if not 3-star for many reasons.  While loyal Apple fans or people who want to use the basic apps but appreciate its design you'll likely give it a 5-star.  So I had to go with the 4-star to be fair.Where the iPad 3 shines:- Gorgeous screen; not much complaint here as watching HD movies including Netflix and YouTube video is amazing- Thin & lightweight; for its size, it's not too big of a hassle to carry around- Beautiful design overall; Apple pretty much set a standard for today's tablets and they still keep simplicity in a beautiful design- Simple; you don't need to know how to use Apple products, great for kids and adults that aren't exactly tech savvy- Amazing battery life; I could play Minecraft for hours and don't eat up batteries like other tablets do- Very responsive; for the most part depending on the app.  Rarely freezes (yes, it still does freeze from time to time) and is fast enough to run any HD games and apps.Where iPad 3 doesn't impress:- No flash.  Flash enabled sites either need a flash compatible browser if not you cannot view the content.- No GPS for the Wifi version; this would annoy you if you're looking to use it for navigation (you'll need separate GPS module made by another company that cost at least $100)- Slow charging; with the wall charger it comes, it does charge very slow.  The only negative side of the longer lasting tablet- Keyboard is not intuitive; difficult to type in landscape mode, no swype or other after-market keyboard like Android has- Expensive; for the money you'd think you'll get more out of the unit- Screen size icons; for the massive screen, you don't have a way to cram more icons forcing you to either create folders within or use multiple screens.- Many apps that are free on Android market often times are not free on Apple Stores.- Proprietary plugs; when will Apple learn?  No HDMI, mini-USB, etc.I personally recommend the iPad Wifi version for:- General entertainment for games, movies and news reading + where Wifi is available- Children; easy to navigate and use- Don't care about GPS navigation or use it for related purpose- Are not tech savvy or don't mind not having flash options- Want something simple and reliable- Want long battery lifeI don't recommend the iPad Wifi version if you:- Want to use this in the car, boat or wherever you need a GPS for navigation and plotting- Want to do any sort of modification including custom ROM's- Need flexibility in terms of the O/S- Are looking for cost savings and best bang for your moneyPersonally I'm more of an Android guy than Apple guy but it doesn't mean Apple's products are bad either.  It's one beautiful tablet I've ever played around with (it's my wife's) and aside from it not having GPS and other features available on Android, it's a solid performer.On a personal note, if they come out with a 7" tablet I wouldn't mind owning one.  Especially if it had GPS even on the Wifi version I'd buy one in a heartbeat.  To me, the pro's outweigh the con's for the iPad 3.  For as long as I can remember I've been a PC-guy where I didn't care for Apple but ever since iPod's came out, they've really changed the computer industry.You won't regret your purchase either way.  Just take note of what's not on the device and what to expect.

Content: Horrible Device For Basic Business Needs!  Too many restrictions! I've had my new iPad for a couple weeks now & I am constantly having road blocks doing basic everyday functions.  Don't be fooled by the slick design & nice screen display, this device has so many limitations compared to other cheaper devices.I think it's good for an entertainment device but it's horrible for business. Here's why....The iPad does not allow a basic way to attach a file to an email.The iPad does not allow a way to upload any content through a web browser. Example, if you wanted to upload your current resume to a career site, there is no way for iPad to do so.  You would have to use your computer or an android device.I'm shocked in 2012 with a hi tech device I'm unable to do the most basic everyday functions.I tested out some cheaper android tablets & they all seem to do the basic internet functions with no problem; even the Kindle Fire!?. Email attachment, upload & download files through the web browser.  All web content is not hosted through iTunes so the restrictions is a big headache.  If you do any business through email & web browsers, do not travel without a laptop.

Content: Glad we upgraded from 1st iPad. We really love our new iPad. The screen resolution is awesome. I like to read on our iPad and you just can't beat the screen clarity. We use the iPad everyday for all sorts of stuff. It's a great size to carry around and having a camera and HD video camera are wonderful. We've had it for over a month and haven't had any problems at all. We did buy a case to protect our iPad. It makes the iPad a little heavier and bulkier but the added protection is well worth it. My husband and I have a small farm and the iPad is perfect for carrying around and recording information about our animals on it. Definately upgrade if you have the 1st generation, you won't regret it.

OK I feel sorry to all of those who were cheated through Verizon or other means.But there is nothing wrong with the product itself; it is just the service/places consumers got them from.Yes, machines/electronics cannot be perfect, but we are getting there.I would say I got more than 500 bucks out of this; so many advantages.Do not feel the need to list them all; best experienced through an actual use of it.

Content: An okay product, but don't believe the hype. I have owned one of these since it first came out. I can see it's use for simply surfing the web and casual gaming, but not much else.Most people know about the iPad, so I'm not going to get into too many specifics, but I will say I simply didn't care of it. I bought it to help with music production, which it was heavily advertised for. It simply does not work that well with music production. I did enjoy the interface it has the Omnisphere, the best VST money can buy in my opinion, but beyond that, I didn't enjoy using it. I tried multiple apps, and for the most part have been greatly disappointed. I would rather use a windows based laptop/tablet or mac and be able to use many more of the products on the market.Don't believe the hype. It is not built for music production. It cannot hold a candle to a PC or a full Mac in that aspect. The guitar effects are never up to par, and it just doesn't have the power it needs to do so, certainly not for the price.

Content: Absolutely fantastic! Couldn't be happier! I bought mine directly from Apple in May, 2012. I got the Wifi + Cellular model for AT&T; so I could have the internet anywhere and everywhere. I have used my iPad every single day and absolutely love it!I resisted getting an iPad for a long time because I could not see a need for one. I already had a MacBook Pro and an iPhone so what would I do with an iPad? It seemed to be a blown up version of the iPhone (without the phone part) and an inferior version of the MacBook Pro (without the keyboard or processing power). So what the heck would I do with this iPad thing?As it turns out, I do a lot with it! I will admit that I play games on it a lot, but I also use it as my main "to go" item. I have it synced with my MacBook Pro and iPhone so it always contains anything that I consider important and want to always take with me (emails, notes, calendars, documents of various kinds, etc). It's my entertainment if I'm ever stuck anywhere, having to wait on something (the apps are much better on the iPad than my iPhone). I keep track of the weather and my kids (AT&T;'s Family Map plan), and the rush hour traffic (which can be a mess in the Houston area). Maps are easier to read and follow with the larger screen than they were on my iPhone. Even reading books is better on the iPad than the iPhone. And, yet, it's easier to carry around than my MacBook Pro; plus, with the cellular contract, I always have the internet available to me at all times.So as it turns out, the iPad does have its place even though I have a MacBook Pro and an iPhone. They each have their specific purposes. Even though I waited years before finally buying my first iPad, I cannot imagine not having an iPad now. And I'm very pleased with the model I selected as it runs all the current software very well and should be able to keep up with whatever comes out in the future for a long time before it becomes so obsolete that I'll have to buy a newer version. Most definitely an excellent buy!

Yes there are other tablets on the market, but Apple's seamless integration between devices (iPhone and mac air) made this the only sensible option for me.Performs as I expected it would and have used more than I thought and is invaluable for both work and home use, some of the educational apps have been a great way of encouraging additional homework for my 7 year old,

Content: Ones upon a time. I always wanted a iPad but fell in love with the kindle fire hd so much I bought two one 7 inch and 1 8.9 .They were pure entertainment devices and very family friendly but they did have there limitations.My work required me to have access to apps that the fire didn't  have  increasing my need for a full tablet experience with that said I did keep my 7 inch fire hd.I love hd entertainment and the iPad didn't disappoint me at all yes I did pay more for the iPad for the extras I needed but its the real deal if you have the luxury of having a fire hd 7 inch and a 10 inch iPad do it because the I pad mini is not a fire hd.Now that I told you my story I have to say the iPad retina has been with me every where I go my tablet is no longer my bedtime device it's a part of my life and yes it does everything it should do well movies ,music ,apps and more and it does it very well .I believe that until someone makes a device that is easy to use and is main stream the 9.7 inch iPad will remain the best tablet on the marketEveryone competes and compares there tablet with the iPad the reason is  they have to its that good but most important you need a tablet in today's world .As a Amazon customer I didn't want to write this review but respectfully I will say if you want a pure entertainment device the 8.9 fire hd is a excellent tablet for half the money and it was totally out of need that I spent the extra money for the iPad and you will have to buy a iPad to even be close to a amazon product or buy both .My only regret was I had to buy a used open box item described as like new and it was like very used in fair and dirty condition the power cord was crazy dirty the tablet had the dirtiest box and finger prints all over the glass it did clean up well but it was only $10.00 less then the same one new at apples online store with a one year warranty but I only found that out after I bought it .Service with amazon is one of the best online and maybe I got the wrong iPad because they sell good,very good, and like new and anything I ever bought like new was either new or real close  who knows maybe after this review they may offer me a new one .Remember the iPad is a great tablet there is no way you won't like it but for the small difference maybe you should buy new and get the real experience .It's like staying in the best hotel and getting a bad room .I plan to give a update so stay tune.

I was so so excited when I completed the purchase and anxiously waited for my ipad to come.  I give the seller 5 stars because he/she deserves it. Not only the ipad's condition was like new, just as the seller stated it was, the shipping was the quickest as can be. Thank you, Thornbird (the seller). I'm a very satisfied customer.

Content: I really love my new iPad. I got the 64 gb iPad 3 and really love it.  I was a little hesitant about spending the money since I already have a Kindle Fire (which I also love).  After convincing the wife, I took the plunge.  I am really happy with my purchase and have nothing but good things to say about the iPad.  It does have a small learning curve to those of us non-Apple people, but I was up and running quickly.  Even my wife (who thought I did not need it lol) thinks it is a good purchase.  Definitely worth the money

Content: Better then I expected. Just received my used ipad 3 and it was like new with no scratches, dents, or cracks. It was only the ipad and charger and it was will package. The only problem I had was the shipping from FedEx. They never showed up to my house and would report as I was not home when I was so I requested that it be held at a fedex location. I was a little nervous that I would receive the wrong ipad but ezcorp sent the right one.

Content: OK. Came a little later than the expected delivery dates, but that wasn't too much of a problem. I bought it refurbished and while the screen is pretty clear of blemishes, the same cannot be said for the rest of the exterior. There were scratches and signs of previous usage on the back and the corners. Did not come with the wall charger either but it did have the cable. All in all, it's in OK condition but it works and does its job.

Content: Hate it. I absolutely hate it. It's basic architecture is such that apps can't communicate productively with each other. As a result, every app has to duplicate computer-like sharing functions that would be trivial in a real computer. Most of the time, they do a miserable job of it. The screen is the best touch screen, so I've read, but that isn't saying much. You often have to keep whacking away at the screen to get it to respond and often the response is for the icon next to the one you're whacking. The whole touch screen user interface is remarkable, but it's very limited. It's simply impossible to make a screen icon or label for even the limited number of actions you can take; the actions for which there's no label/icon are basically secret. You may stumble over them, you may not. You certainly will never have the functionality of a real computer.In spite of all the problems of the iPad and its imitators, many people buy them. If you limit yourself to simple email handling, on the level of what we had 30+ years ago before the web, taking pictures, and browsing web sites while not using them to do much, I suppose the iPad is a decent enough choice. But don't buy a new one. The used ones are half the price and they're in terrific condition.

Content: ATT Signal stronger on 3G version (iPad 2) This is going to be a short review since I'm basically comparing both versions of my iPad. I have both versions, receiving my iPad 3 via FedEx this morning. So I've had a little time to compare them side by side instead of reading all the great things the iPad 3 can do online etc.The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that the packaging was no different than the iPad 2. The only difference being that it states 32GB 4G on the new iPad (3) instead of 32GB 3G on the iPad 2. Set up was very simple. There was no need for me to connect it to iTunes which I dreaded. It came 80% charged and all the steps needed to connect and set up your new iPad is actually done on the iPad without you needing to connect it to iTunes.Edit: Just realized that this means that for those who have a windows based PC and don't want to install iTunes, all you need is an apple ID. In order to get one you can go to appleid.apple.com. Once you have that you can purchase all you need from iTunes without the use of a computer. Great for those who also don't own a computer although in this day almost everyone has one. :)The clarity of the new iPad is a lot clearer compared to the iPad 2, (I've uploaded a pic but you may not notice it since it still has the plastic on that it came with). It's also a little heavier than the iPad 2. I did notice though that my ATT signal is a lot stronger on the 3G version compared to the new iPad. I have a lot more bars. If that's going to be a problem then I'd suggest getting the iPad 2 unless you're just going to be using the WiFi option.Here's my pros of the new iPad. The 5mp rear facing camera compared to barely existent one on the iPad 2. Sure you're still not going to get pictures you can send in to National Geographic but it's a lot better than before. If you want it to just use as a camera you're still going to be disappointed. The retina display makes your screen pop and sure makes it look a lot more vibrant. The processor is supposed to be a faster but I really didn't see much of a difference when going from page to page on the Safari built in browser. Both iPad have the new iOS 5.1 software.If you have the money I'd grab the new iPad (3) but if you don't I'd stick with the iPad 2. You'd still be getting a great tablet no matter which one you chose.

Content: Simply Spectacular!! I pre-ordered my new iPad and got it on Friday, 3/16/12. It is my first iPad. I do own an iPhone 4S, and I did briefly purchase an iPad2 back toward the end of January. However, I took it back because I expected that the display would equal to that of my iPhone4, but it was not. I heard there would be a new one coming out in the spring, so I returned my iPad2 within one week of purchasing it. I only played with it a day or two, and so glad I did return it. The new iPad was more than well worth the wait! :)Words simply cannot describe just how intense the screen resolution is, and how vibrant the colors are. Simply SPECTACULAR!! Stunning! The speed is excellent, the photos are crisp and clear, and if someone has a small piece of fuzz on their hair, for example, it will clearly be seen in their photo, as was such with one photo that I took! :)I own a white 16GB Wi-Fi only version.There are a few issues that I have experienced, however, and also read on the Apple Support Forum that others are also experiencing. I also took my new iPad to my local Apple Store yesterday to ask some questions.First, the new iPads heat up. This is due to the new and larger battery. I was told at the Apple Store that this is nothing to be concerned about. Some, although not myself, claim that their new iPads are actually too hot to touch. I have not experienced that. Mine does get extremely warm, but, nowhere near too hot too tiuch. So, you may want to beware of that, and purchase a Smart Cover to fold and hold your iPad with. (It's a good idea to have one to protect your screen, also! :))I have also experienced issues with iTunes, and read others have, too. ITunes simply "kicked me out" when I tried to look at movie information, not even trying to download a movie. It kicked me out and returned to the home screen. It did this several times. Tried the re-boot, but still kicked me out. Others have reported problems with downloading content from iTunes, as well. I don't know why this is happening. I heard that one possibility could be that with so many new iPad users, all trying to sync and download, that it is causing these issues. Or, it could be a glitch that will need to be corrected by Apple. Just don't know. I'm not worried about it though, because I feel confident that it will be resolved in one way or another.The battery seems to drain pretty quickly. Especially for me because I crank my screen up to maximum brightness. :) And, so far, my new iPad takes an INCREDIBLY long time to charge. I was told at the Apple Store to be sure to let the battery run all the way down before charging, and that after a few times doing that, this will improve. Time will tell! I've read others also are experiencing this issue. I bought a 6 foot charger at the Apple Store yesterday so that I can plug in and charge, and still use while charging it. I found out that it is completely safe to use the new iPad (or any iProduct) while charging, so, that is very helpful to me.I am in love with my new iPad, and am VERY, VERY happy with it. I recommend to all. :) It is truly incredible, and better than I ever imagined it would be. :)

Content: It's a Tablet, a Big Battery Wireless Hotspot, a GPS, a XHD TV, a Portal, a Windows 8 Tablet! How did the lowly tablet come to steamroll the PC market? By it's overwhelming usability. I'm so impressed by the versatility of the New iPad 4G Verizon LTE. I thought I would only use it to consume media. It does that and much more. In the first few days of ownership, I've used it as a portal into the world. I find it more comfortable than a PC to read Wikipedia, see amazing photos, and watch instructional videos. The display is the first mobile device to use XHD resolution -- much higher resolution and better fidelity than today's desktop monitors. When I travel, I no longer have to pack a wireless router, GPS (via cellular radio), Kindle, iPod, extra rechargers or cables. The iPad becomes a big battery WiFi hotspot via its cellular modem. I've loaded Windows 8 Consumer Preview on several notebooks. With the use of SplashTop server and iPad app called "Win8 Metro Testbed", I'm able to use the iPad as a Windows 8 tablet. Works well. This one device has both simplified and amplified my life. The device's primary negative is some screen glare and complete washout in bright sunlight. eInk is much superior in that environment.Update 17-Apr-2012: In Paris, both my New iPad and iPhone are working with Free.fr SIM cards. Free.fr's SIM is 20 Euros per month, prepaid, and includes 3GB data usage. If the device has a phone (iPhone) it includes unlimited voice and SMS. The iPhone needs no special settings. iPhone and iPad both work with Personal Hotspots feature on free.fr. For data use, the iPad requires an APN setting of "free" in Cellular Data settings, and again in Personal Hotspot if that feature is desired. Free.fr uses the Orange.fr 3G network -- France's largest. Using Speedtest.net, I usually get > 1Mbps download speeds and as high as 10Mbps sometimes. Data usage requires 3G which is ubiquitous in Paris but voice works fine on 2G (usually found in Metros).

Content: Decent upgrade from the iPad2; some compromise. I love my iPad 2. The weight and size was about the max that I thought I could withstand in a handheld device.  For me, the iPad 3 is a set of compromises that I decided was worth it in the end.Weight/thickness: If you hold your iPad a lot when using it, then I think you will notice the extra heft of the third gen iPad.  It's not major, but it's noticeable. I find that I become a fatigued more quickly when reading in bed or holding the iPad on the plan while watching a movie, etc.Heat:  Yes, it runs a lot warmer than my iPad 2.  You will notice it.  The heat adds to the overall fatigue, largely because the greatest heat occurs exactly where you hold the iPad in portrait mode (lower left corner). Sure would have been nice if they cold have flipped something around inside to put the greatest heat elsewhere.Screen:  Nice improvement over the iPad2.  Makes reading easier on the eyes.  No more jagged fonts. When I go back to reading on my iPad 2, I wonder how in the word I managed with it.  Colors are more vibrant too.  I won't call is revolutionary, but it is a very nice upgrade.  At the end of the day, my iPad 2 would still be fine if I had never seen the iPad 3 screen.LTE:  This is a major selling point for me.  AT&T; LTE has been faster than both my home and work WiFi.  I did notice that LTE drains the battery very quickly, however.  I saw a 10% drop in battery within about 15 minutes while using LTE.  Battery drain was much slower when I jumped onto my work wifi.Overall:  I am happy with the new iPad, but I do find that I miss the smaller size and weight of the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 "disappears" when you use it, which was Steve Job's main objectives.  The iPad 3 does not have the same effect.  The screen pulls you in, but the extra heft becomes apparent more quickly.  IF the heft doesn't become noticeable, the heat will get your attention.  The heat is within acceptable limits, but it is there to remind you that you are holding an electronic device.  It's harder to get lost in that book or movie.  So if the magic of the iPad disappearing is important to you, then wait for the fourth gen which is bound to be lighter and cooler.  If you want a graphics and LTE workhorse that you will use on a table more than holding free-form in your hand, then the iPad 3 is a good choice.  Overall, I prefer the iPad 2 for the reason that it does disappear and pull you in.  Already waiting to see if the iPad 4 returns to this experience.

Content: Great at what it is intended to do. If you like reading books, watching TV shows or Movies, and playing games, then this device is perfect. However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about. I've rarely had difficulty finding a hot spot at any destination I've travelled to.

Content: Pictures Are Sharper.  Print Improvement is Dramatic. I just bought the new iPad and had the chance to compare it side my side with our iPad 2.  Other people have provided more extensive reviews, but I wanted to give my two cents on the new Retina Display.Photos definitely look more crisp on the new iPad.  In particular, areas of photos that include fine detail are noticeably cleaner and sharper.  As Apple advertises, if you look closely at, say, someone with a white shirt in a photo on the iPad 2 you can actually see the display pixels, which obviously limits the sharpness of the photo.  If you look at the same white shirt on the new iPad you cannot see the pixels; you just see a smooth area of pure white shirt.I think the difference between the new iPad and the iPad 2 is most dramatic when you view print, whether in a browser article or in an electronic book.  On the new iPad the boundary between fonts and the white page background is much, much cleaner and sharper.  This will make the new iPad much better for reading, with sharper fonts and less eye strain.

As soon as I told my wife she went into to cardiac arrest and my baby turned into a werewolf. I was soon over taken by the zombies that made a cult in my basement. The whole city of Southboro was OVERTAKEN AND I HAD TO MOVE. In recap the Ipad made me lose my wife my baby and my house (Not to mention the city of Southboro).

Content: It is great! I bought it three days ago and it was a second hand "like new". It is working very well, came fast and we also received a case for it as a gift. It was a good deal! We also could go to the apple store and register it under the new name. This ipad was bought two months before and we still have 11 days for getting some support online if we need to. My son is having lots of fun and we could downloud some educational games. My husband and I didn't have our turns yet. But we checked and we can access our emails. Our family is very happy!

Content: Wish I'd had it earlier. I can't begin to explain just how awesome the new iPad is.  The camera is exceptional for not having a flash, the device is incredibly responsive and I love reading on it.  Surfing the web is so much more fun now and all your iPod iPhone apps will run on it, just won't be as pretty or sometimes as detailed as the iPad versions.  Watching movies on the larger retina display makes you feel bad for those saps watching on HD tvs.

Content: its great BUT not that much of a difference from ipad 2. I switched from the ipad 2 tot he ipad 3, I have to say that the ipad 3 isnt much different from the ipad 2, it just has a better camera, voice to message, and a bit faster. That being said i guess I expected a little more for the new generation. But of course I still love the display and what nots. Still a great tablet (the best).

Content: Very handy and convenient. It is so much easier than a laptop to tote and use when traveling. The thing that I don't like is that it doesn't work with adobe flash player, though I have been able to live without it.  I use it practically every day in some form, if just listening to the music that is stored on it or an internet radio app. There are plenty of apps to choose from both free and pay for. The battery life is amazing. I can use it for short periods of times throughout the day and not have to recharge for days. The picture quality is excellent, but I would have liked stereo speakers over the mono speaker.

The resolution is awesome.  I own a android tablet and it works good but not as good as this.  Yes, it is a little more expensive but I guess you get what you pay for.  So far I have had no problems.  I would recommend this product.

Content: Better then I expected. Just received my used ipad 3 and it was like new with no scratches, dents, or cracks. It was only the ipad and charger and it was will package. The only problem I had was the shipping from FedEx. They never showed up to my house and would report as I was not home when I was so I requested that it be held at a fedex location. I was a little nervous that I would receive the wrong ipad but ezcorp sent the right one.

I use mine in a portfolio case for work and then in a LifeProof waterproof case for use in an offroad vehicle for GPS with no phone signal. Make s a huge GPS display much larger than even very expensive Lowrance or similar systems. Use RAM mounts for any mounting needed. Many apps for GPS ... works great deep in the forest. Fair battery life.

Content: excellent! the product met my expectation. i bought a used iPad 3 but believe me it came in as if it had never been taken out of the box. it had no sign of wear and tear, its battery life is excellent, its operations are sharp and the microphone is loud. i initially complained about the picture quality but when i checked with my friends that had the same product, it was practically the same and now i am used to it. and concerning the shipping, it came in supper fast(received my package earlier than the estimated date). the only thing is that iPad does not have USB port like some other tablets but with time u find ur way around that, lol. i love my iPad because it has all the features i wanted in a tablet.

Content: The only option for aviation apps. I bought my iPad 3 for using aviation apps in my airplane. The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.

NEVER HAD TO USE ANY WARRANTY AT ALL SINCE THE DAY I GOT IT. the Apple infrastructure is quite robust, the perfect synergy of software and hardware, I would not hesitate buying another iPad -once this one breaks. The retina screen is still quite good despite newer offerings from competitors. The touch controls are very responsive and nary a skip or stall.

Content: Should you upgrade from iPad 2?  Should you buy a new 4th-gen iPad instead? UPDATE November 2012As you know, Apple has just discontinued this 3rd-generation model and replaced it with a 4th generation iPad.  This is good news if you're a buyer.  You have the option of buying the newest iPad.  But you have another option that I think is pretty attractive:  buying a used 3rd-generation iPad at a much reduced price.The differences between the 3rd and 4th generation iPads are mostly minor and won't affect the actual experience of using the device for many folks.  The 3rd and 4th gen iPads have the same wonderful retina display, they are the same size and weight, and they have the same battery life.So what's different?  The 4th gen iPad has a faster chip and Apple tweaked the wifi and cellular connectivity.  But as an owner, I can tell you that the 3rd-gen iPad is plenty fast and the internet connectivity via wifi or 3G/4G cellular is excellent.  Really excellent.The 4th gen iPad has a different type of connector, so if you have previously invested in speaker docks and other accessories designed for the old connector, it'll be harder to use them with the new iPad (you'll need to buy adapters, and even they don't solve all compatibility problems). I have a new iPhone 5 that has this new type of connector, and while I love the phone, the incompatibility problems with my existing accessories are frustrating.The introduction of the latest iPad last week is already causing the prices of 3rd-gen iPads to drop--even though they are at most 7 months old.  It should be very possible to find a like-new 3rd gen iPad that's maybe 5-6 months old at a much lower price.  This is an option worth considering.As for me, I'm still very happy with my 3rd-gen iPad and I plan to keep it for a couple more years.My original review follows, with a few minor edits and updates to reflect new information.----This review is for iPad 2 owners trying to decide whether to upgrade to the 3rd generation iPad.  It also might be helpful for people deciding between buying a 3rd-gen iPad the now-cheaper iPad 2.I was perfectly happy with my iPad 2, a wifi-only model with 32gb.  When Apple announced the 3rd generation iPad, I typed up a long list of reasons why I shouldn't buy it.  And then I bought one anyway.  (I'll be giving my iPad 2 to my parents.)You've probably already know what features the 3rd-gen iPad has, and how the specs compare to the iPad 2's specs.  But comparing specs on paper is different than comparing the actual experience of using the two products, and the experience matters more than the specs.  I can tell you which of those features, at least to me, really makes the experience of using the new iPad better.  And there's only one:  the display.I do a lot of reading on the iPad, and this is where the retina display really matters.  Text is very sharp, even for very small fonts, and this makes reading on iPad much more comfortable.  I've been reading Steve Jobs on my iPad 2 (using the Kindle app); I read the next chapter on the retina iPad and then tried to read the following chapter on the iPad 2 again, and going back to the iPad 2 was unpleasant.  I had similar results when I compared reading articles on websites using Safari and when reading a few pages of War and Peace in the iBooks app on the retina iPad vs. iPad 2.  After reading on the new iPad, you just won't want to go back to reading on iPad 2.If you read a lot on your iPad, this to me is a compelling reason to upgrade, and perhaps the only compelling reason.What about photos?  Videos?  Games?  Here, you can tell the difference, and the retina display is better.  But in terms of how much the retina display increases my enjoyment of viewing pictures, video, and games, it is not enough to justify the cost of upgrading.On both iPads, I compared hi-res pictures I took at the Chicago Botanic Gardens using a DSLR with a good lens.  On iPad 2, your eye can indeed discern individual pixels if you look closely enough, whereas on the retina iPad, it's like looking at a real print of the photo.  But after looking at the pictures on the retina iPad, and even noticing the differences, it was still quite nice to view them again on the iPad 2.  Similarly for video:  I watched a scene from the Breaking Bad season 4 finale on both devices, and while it looked a bit better on the retina iPad, it still looked great on iPad 2.  Streaming hi-res movie trailers looked better on the retina iPad, but still looked great on iPad 2. For streaming video from Netflix, I could not tell any difference, most likely because the resolution of the source material isn't any higher than the iPad 2's display.I'm less of a gamer than most iPad users, but I did try Sky Gamblers: Air Supremacy (a game supposedly optimized for the retina display) and Plants vs. Zombies HD (an older game).  PvZ looks exactly the same on both, Sky Gamblers looks better on the retina iPad but it still looks very awesome on the iPad 2.In short, you can notice the difference the retina display makes for photos, videos, and games.  Yet, the experience of using the iPad 2 is still quite excellent.  The fact is that, even at a lower resolution, the iPad 2's IPS display is exceptional.What about the other specs?  Is it worth upgrading to get a newer processor, for example?No.  I really don't notice a difference in performance.  The 3rd-gen iPad is super fast, but so is iPad 2.  Some apps load a little faster, others I can't tell.  But the speed difference, if any, isn't enough to make the 3rd-gen iPad more enjoyable to use than iPad 2.What about battery life?  The retina display has 4x the pixels of the iPad 2 display and requires a lot more power, which would drain the battery faster.  But the new iPad also comes with a much bigger battery inside (that's why it's 1/10 of an inch thicker and an ounce or so heavier than iPad 2).  Apple says battery life is about the same, and that seems to be true in my experience in seven months I bought it.What about the improved camera?  Sure, it takes better pictures than the joke of a camera on iPad 2.  But do most people use their iPad for photography, anyway?  If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, your camera is just as good or better as the camera on the 3rd-gen iPad, and taking pictures with the cameras on iPhone and most smart-phones is more convenient than using the iPad.  Ditto for most smartphones.  And only the rear-facing camera was improved; the front-facing camera is just as crappy as before.  And that's a shame, because the front camera is the one I'd actually use (for skype and facetime).What about dictation?  I find it works about 80%, less in a noisy room.  Sure, it is easier to dictate and then edit the few errors that result than to type something from scratch on the iPad's on-screen keyboard.  But I don't think most people will use the dictation feature enough for it to matter in the upgrade decision.  People who write a lot on the iPad will already have an external keyboard (or should get one).So, for me, the only new feature that matters enough to justify the upgrade from iPad 2 is the retina display.But there's one other reason you might upgrade:  If your iPad 2 is a wifi-only model and you think it would be handy to also have 3G/4G connectivity.  (Or, if you bought an iPad 2 with 3G and you never use the 3G, now is your chance to buy an iPad without it and save $130.)  I bought a new iPad with 4G so that I could use it when I'm traveling and away from a hotspot.  Which isn't very often, but I figured it would be handy to have.What about 3G vs. 4G?  If you have an iPad 2 with 3G, should you upgrade to enjoy the faster speed of 4G?  The answer is only if you use it a lot.4G on the new iPad is very fast.  My iPad 2 doesn't have 3G, so I can't say how much faster.  My verizon iphone 4S has 3G and it's way slower than a wifi connection, but 4G on the new iPad is at least as fast as a good wifi connection.That said, the cellular service is not cheap, so most people use it only when wifi is not available, which is not very often.  You have wifi at home, at work perhaps, at most coffee shops and libraries and hotels.  The exception would be people that have an expensive plan with a high data allowance; if that's you and you use cellular connectivity a lot, then you have a good reason to upgrade.  4G is crazy fast.A reader emailed me another good reason to consider an iPad with cellular connectivity (4G on the 3rd-generation iPad, 3G on the iPad 2) instead of just the wifi-only model.  iPads with 3G or 4G also have a true GPS receiver built-in that will work anywhere you can get a cellular internet connection.(Actually, the GPS radio inside the 3G/4G ipads will pick up a signal anywhere, even if you're not in a location with service; but you can't see your location on a map unless you either (1) have internet access so that the maps can be accessed from the cloud, or (2) pre-download the maps to your device, but they will take up a TON of space, at least a few GB, depending on the app you're using.)The wifi-only model can estimate your location when you are connected to a wifi hotspot based on the location of the hotspot.  But it's less precise than the true GPS that comes in the 3G iPad 2 or 4G new iPad.  And, the location features of the wifi-only iPads don't work when you're moving (as in a car, plane, or boad) or away from a wifi hotspot.But the 4G model contains a true GPS chip.  It is very precise, and combined with 4G connectivity, your iPad can take advantage of some great navigation apps. For example, your iPad can effectively become a Garmin with a huge 10" display.  And there are lots of apps for hiking in the national parks, or fishing, or aviation, that take full advantage of the GPS inside the iPad models with 3G or 4G.Thanks very much to the reader who emailed me this info; I'd forgotten to include it, even though I use and love the GPS mapping on my iPad.But back to the main point of my review, whether to upgrade from iPad 2.  Upgrading is a tough call, because it's expensive.  The difference between what you'll get if you sell your iPad 2 and what you'll spend for a similarly configured retina iPad is probably around $250, maybe a little more.  And if you upgrade, you might want more memory since apps designed for the retina display take up more space than standard apps designed for the iPad 2's display.I recommend that most iPad 2 owners upgrade only if they really want or need the retina display, especially for people who do a lot of reading on iPad.  Or, if they bought a wifi-only iPad 2 and always regretted not getting cellular internet, now's their chance.If neither of these is true for you, stick with your iPad 2.  It is still an absolutely great device, and still a very worthy purchase for people who want an ipad but can't afford or don't need the retina display.----------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE APRIL 22----------------------------------------------------------------Still very happy after 5 weeks.  Excellent battery life, and no heat problems as some have reported.In case you're considering a 4G iPad with Verizon, you should know that Verizon offers two types of service plans. You should know the difference between them before you buy.  I didn't, and it was a hassle and unnecessary expense.The two plans are "post-paid" and "pre-paid."  Pre-paid has no activation fee.  Post-paid has a $35 activation fee.  The cheapest pre-paid plan is $20/month for 1 gig.  The cheapest post-paid plan is $30/month for 2 gigs.  So if you use wi-fi as much as possible and don't use 3G/4G a lot, you've got 2 reasons to choose pre-paid.The pre-paid plan also has an option for 2 gigs for $30, same price as the post-paid plan, and you can pre-pay for larger amounts of data for the same prices you'd pay with the post-paid plan.  So you really don't give up anything by choosing the pre-paid plan, as far as I can tell.You control the pre-paid plan from the ipad itself (under settings > cellular).  You can easily set up the account, choose the option you want, buy more data if you need it, and do all this without any help from Verizon customer service.  Furthermore, you can purchase data only when you'll need it, with no activation fees, ever.You control the post-paid plan from the verizon website.  You can "suspend" service when you don't need it, for a limited amount of time, and you won't be billed during this time.  If you suspend it, better write down in your calendar when the suspension will end, because you'll start getting billed automatically on that date.  I think there are restrictions on how many times per year you can suspend the service, and how long you can suspend it for.  There are no such restrictions on the pre-paid plan.I bought my iPad at a Verizon store and, without explaining the differences between these plans, they set up my iPad for the post-paid plan before I left the store.  I didn't find out about the different plans until a month later when I got my first bill and saw the $35 activation fee and the $30 charge for 2 gigs.  I thought I was going to be paying $20 for 1 gig.I called VZ customer service, learned about the two plans, and asked to switch from post-paid to pre-paid.  This turned out to be a hassle.  The two types of plans are managed by completely separate departments that don't communicate well with each other.  One department turns off your post-paid plan, which fries the sim card in your iPad.  Before you can start a pre-paid plan, you have to get another sim card.  Some verizon stores believe that they are not allowed by corporate to give you or sell you a sim card unless they install it and activate it to a new account, and you don't want that if you're switching to pre-paid; I had to go to two different stores with calls to customer service in between to get my sim card.  Once I had the sim card, it was super easy to replace the fried one and then set up my pre-paid plan.I learned that Verizon stores make a commission when they sell you a post-paid plan.  That's probably why the guy set me up with a post-paid plan when I bought the iPad.  He acted like he was doing me a favor by setting up my device.  That's shameful, and all of this is a huge surprise to me - I've been with Verizon for 8 years and generally had excellent customer service, both on the phone and in Verizon corporate stores.Despite these hassles, I still recommend Verizon to folks considering an iPad with 4G cellular.  Verizon's 4G service covers way more of the U.S. than AT&T;'s 4G service.  And you can avoid the hassles I experienced by telling the Verizon store NOT to set you up on a post-paid plan when you buy the iPad - or, better yet, buy it from an Apple store.

Content: It's just a shame! Connection and Photo Syncing Annoyances. I actually bought the Ipad 3, 64GB wi-fi version from Apple maybe a month or so ago.  Long story short is that I absolutely love the Ipad for everything it can do, BUT, there were two reasons why I ultimately returned it:1. Connections:  I still really find it annoying that the only connection you have to this Ipad is the normal connection as seen on every single previous version of the Ipad.  Look, I know there is that adapter that you can buy separately that connects a USB cord to the Ipad as well as the SD card as well:[...]But, the general public that has bought the item specifically for the Ipad 3 are consistently complaining that it is very shotty and doesn't really work.2. THE BIG ONE!!!:  Itunes and the TERRIBLE interface when trying to sync photos from your computer (either PC or Mac ... and for me specifically a PC with Windows 7, 64bit), to the Ipad 3.  Not, Ipad 2, I'm taking about the Ipad 3.  Why is nobody complaining about this HUGE problem on this site?  If you don't believe me, just type in "Ipad 3 Photo Syncing Problem" on Google, and be amazed.  If you want to save the time, click on the below link which will take you directly to the blog as discussed on Apple's own community website.[...]Just start from that page and read on through 23 other pages, of complaints with this issue.  Some people offered solutions, some worked, but the bottom line is is that Apple continues to deny this problem, and there has been no recent fix/update with Itunes to remedy it.  Even though Itunes update 10.6.1 says:About iTunes 10.6.1iTunes 10.6.1 provides a number of improvements, including:* Fixes several issues that may cause iTunes to unexpectedly quit while playing videos, changing artwork size in Grid view, and syncing photos to devices.So, all in all, once Apple fixes this issue, I will not get the Ipad 3 again.  People reading this, please post your comments if you are experiencing the same annoyance that I experienced.  It is truly a shame as the majority of people that buy this product want to use it to show off their amazing high rez photos on the beautiful Retina Display that the Ipad 3 has.Thoughts?

Content: OWNED IPAD 1, 2 AND NOW 3. No long review or repeat of specs here...Weight and size are virtually unnoticeable although its a bit thicker.....Fits in the original iPad 1 case. I've used this case for all three iPads....It does run a bit hot....  Processor is faster.. Screen is very very clear....Still slow battery charge and NO FLASH player.... I would not have purchased iPad 3 but the company I work for gives us points to spend each quarter and had enough points to purchase this iPad....It's really quite nice.....iPad 2 resale is a no brainer.  Just tell everyone at work you want to sell your iPad...It takes about a day.  eReaders are for old folks (because they actually know how to read) nothing compares to an iPad.  Other tablets are just wanna be's......I have enjoyed owning iPad...I use it with a Verizon Samsung 4g LTE.... at Dr's appt.'s, at lunch, during break time, at work.....They slowly keep getting better and better..

Content: Returning It :\ I bought the newest ipad over the weekend and will be returning it in a few daysThe retina display is overrated. Streaming video looks like garbage. The apps haven't kept up with the technology. And the display is nothing special unless brightness is turned way up, to which it then hurts my eyes.The other negative is weight. When you're just sitting somewhere and need to hoist it up it wears on you. And it gets very hot. You have to lay it against something to utilize it best.Postives- The camera is nice. Facebook (and photos people post), Twitter and some games are a real pleasure to use on this.  Or if you like IOS or certain Apple exclusive apps. But other than that, it's not worth $500+ to view social media or for a picture slideshow. I bought it for streaming video and Netflix, Directv, MLB etc all look like garbage.

Content: Needs an SD Slot Desperately. The iPad 3 is pretty much the iPad 2 with a better screen and nothing more. That statement is of course not entirely technologically factual. But at the end of the day, it is feels more true than the fact that there are differences in specifications between the two devices.Ram, processor -The iPad 2 in some instances felt constrained with only 512mb of ram, so the iPad 3 was supposed to feel like an improvement when it comes to app management and multitasking. However, that difference is negligible. The iPad 3 packs 1GB of ram which is the minimum amount required for an acceptable experience. But due to the fact that the iPad 3 is driving 4 times as much pixels in the screen as the iPad 2, the experience is pretty much the same. Both devices render websites at the same speed, some games are faster on the iPad 2, some games have greater detail (yeah, believe it) on the ipad 2 than the 3, etc. The design of the iPad 3 chip shows a great increase in power even though it is still is clocked at 1Ghz due do a doubling of graphic cores from 2 to 4. But testing reveals that the increase in power is entirely used to drive that high definition screen and is not felt elsewhere.Screen, application size and Internet usage -The improvements in the screen are magnificent for people who care about reading on the iPad. But then again a lot of users do not notice a difference between the screens, and i was one of them. Staring at both iPad 2 and 3 side by side does not reveal the WOW factor to me that everyone has been talking about. What is obvious is that apps that are used on iPad 3 are much larger than the same apps for iPad 2 since these apps must have high definition imagery. So if an app is 20mb for iPad 2, the same app may be 80-100mb for iPad 3. If an app is 100mb for iPad 2, that app may be 400mb for iPad 3. If you're using a limited plan to download these apps, you may be running out of bandwidth sooner than you anticipated, and if you only bought an iPad 3 16GB like I did, it may only take a day to run out of storage space. 16gb was definitely not enough. The iPad line now needs an SD slot more than ever.- Processor - improvement is negligible and not felt over iPad 2- Ram - improvement is negligible and not felt during multitasking- Storage - it's the same storage for the same price, but more limited due to an increase in app size to support the high definition screen. You run out of storage faster than before. Charging the same price for limited storage is also a big NO. Apple should have already made 32GB the norm and included an SD slot.- Screen - improvement is obvious especially in reading and text rendering, but to some it's a drawback since it increases app size- NO Sd card slot to increase storage is truly disappointing. This is my main problem with the iPad line, and with the 3rd iPad it got even worse.-  Great 9 to 10 hour battery life- iPad 3 is thicker and heavier than iPad 2 - again a drawback- iPad 3 also has a warmer corner than iPad 2, not that big a deal, but an annoying featureFor me all of these factors caused me to return the iPad 3 within a week, but since I needed a tablet for textbook use, web reading, and my partner was already annoyed at me using his iPad 2 all the time, I walked into a GameStop and picked up a used 64gb iPad 2 plus 3G for $499 and 2 free iTunes gift cards totaling $100. The same price as an iPad 3 16gb. That was a much better deal in my mind than the iPad 3.The iPad 3 is not worth the hype, and since it under-delivers in almost every category but for the screen and 4G, I do not recommend its purchase. If you own an iPad 2, wait for the 4th to come out. If you're purchasing a new tablet, I'd consider the iPad 2 for $399 16gb or a used one with larger capacity for a cheaper price. Or the nexus 16gb for $249. Just remember iPad 2 has no Siri, dictation or other advances present in the iPad 3 due to apple's choice to only include the latest features with the latest iPad.  My jailbroken iPad 2 does Siri and dictation as well as an iPhone 4S and iPad 3. All in all I'm happy with my decision. 64GB of storage is fantastic.If iPad 4 comes with an SD slot, I'll definitely be looking to upgrade in the next year, if not my iPad 2 will be standing with me for the foreseeable future.Make the decision that best works for you.Good luck!

Content: Great screen protector , good value. The Moshi iVisor XT for the iPad was the recommended screen protector from a salesperson in the AT&T; store.  Takes seconds to unwrap and install.  The only part that has a sticky film is the outer edge that does not attach to the screen (leaves no residue when removed).  Don't let the guys at the mall kiosk sell you the Ghost Armor.  They basically have to bake the film on to your device.  This protector can easily be pulled off and washed or dusted.  There are no bubbles.  I have my iPad in a leather portfolio and I can't even tell that the screen protector is on (no loss of sharpness to screen).  I would also highly recommend purchasing this via Amazon.  I paid $25 and it was $40 at the AT&T; store.  Well worth the money.

Content: iPad 3 = Still King of the Hill! I've owned android tablets in the past, and...for what it's worth, there is some very good hardware out there. For instance: Google Nexus 7, and the Asus Transformer...however. After owning the Google nexus 7, I didn't enjoy using it. The hardware was VERY nice, but there are some things I didn't like about android. Yes, it's more customizable...but it's not user friendly like the iPad is. I realize that the "best tablet" is what you use it for, but I find that Apple's ahead of the game. The iPad 3 screen is absolutely magnificent! As for the problem with it heating up, I live in Florida. High 80's is a nice cool day...I don't have ANY problems with heat. However, it does get warm. I guess I don't find it to be a problem. After using it for 3 hours, it's still way cooler than your laptop would be...Alright, well that went on longer than I wanted it to...but I hope this cleared somethings up for people that are still shopping.Long story short: Android is fun/iOS is usableWritten from my iPad 3

Content: Excellent Product AND Amazon Rocks! . Received the IPAD quickly and in excellent condition (Amazon provides great service).  Outstanding product, the new Retina display is absolutely awesome!  After a few days I noticed that Apple was releasing a new model IPAD, one with a faster processor, better camera, etc.  I returned my IPAD to Amazon with no problems or delay in getting my credit card reimbursed since I was well within the Amazon return period.  Amazon rocks!  They provide unequaled service to the customer - great products, quick deliveries, reasonable prices and an outstanding return policy.  Whenever I want to buy anything, Amazon is the first place I visit and, almost all the time, where I buy my item(s).

Content: Have tried other tablets - iPad still the best. We were against buying an iPad because of the cost and seemingly "blind" following of all things Apple.  We both have iPhones, but only because my husband's company pays for our cell phone plan (though we are happy with those).  Living in Austin, TX, all we hear about is Apple products because of their offices here.My family purchased us an Asus Tablet that works with the Andorid platform, so we were happy with the apps and overall use.  I used it mostly for reading Kindle books, and he used it for reading the news.  My company bought all of its employees iPads this past fall, and we simply fell in love with it...to the point we were having problems sharing it.  The browsing speed is so much faster, and we can stream videos for hours without the battery losing even 50% of its capacity.  It is also nice to sync it with our email accounts and iTunes, and it was easier to respond to emails using the iPad versus the Asus.  We also enjoyed taking pictures with it.  iPhones take better quality pictures, but the iPad works fine for still images and decent lighting.  Taking video is also easy, and we can text message pics and links between out iPad and other cell phones.About 6 weeks later, I bought this iPad (which was a great deal compared to buying it in the store).  While I use my iPad for email, Twitter, Facebook, Skype, and watching shows on Hulu and Netflix, my husband uses his all the time for browsing the news and streaming videos.  The apps are limitless, and the computing speed is so fast.This is great for anyone with existing Apple products or the person who has nothing Apple related.  We were disbelievers, and now we understand what all the hype is about.  You won't find us standing in line for the next release, but we wouldn't rule out buying another one some day.  We are fiscally responsible people, and I doubted spending the money...but it was worth it!

When the person I gave it to started using the iPad he discovered that it had a problem called "sticker keys" where the keys randomly act like they're being used, when they aren't. Luckily the iPad was less than a year old and we exchanged it for a new one at the apple store, but I'm very upset that I had to pay so much for a broken iPad! This seller should have either fixed the problem or not sold it to me in the first place.

Content: It is what you expect from a Apple product. I upgraded from the iPad 1 to the iPad 3, this is a great upgrade. My wife has a iPad 2 and there is not a lot of an upgrade from 2 - 3 but I would defiantly suggest an upgrade from iPad1 to iPad 3. As far as the Wi-Fi I did not want another Bill for the 3-G and in the country that I live in you can tether from your phone. So that was not an issue for me I do use my iPad every day but I do not use the internet outside of the house every day. I do tether sometimes but it is not that important to me.

Content: Love my iPad 3 - great addition to a solo law practice. I've had my iPad 3 for a little over a month and it has changed the way I work. I am a solo attorney and it has helped with my organization and efficiency which is critical for a busy solo. In particular, I've stopped taking notes on paper. I used to have legal pads littering my office but I've consolidated all my note taking and exclusively use my iPad. I also download research and, although I don't handle much litigation, I did get the opportunity to use my iPad at a hearing. The judge even commented on it.Plants vs Zombies 2 and Flipboard aren't bad either :-)

Content: Love it. I do a lot of cross country Harley riding and needed something that could handle the needs of an extended trip, i.e. banking, weather, hotel reservations, communications with the home front etc.but smaller and more packable than a lap top.  This is my first experience with an Apple product and it has exceeded expectations in both capabilities and durability.  The picture taking and sending features are particularly good.  Facetime is a lot of fun as well.  Love it...

Content: Great tablet, horrible sellers. I won't go ahead and give this tablet a 1 star rating because of all the no-life sellers selling this for way above retail even when there's tons here In the Tampa Bay area so I'm sure there are many everywhere else.Pros:The screen, I cannot stretch this enough, this should be a selling point right when you pick one up, it is INSANE how sharp it looks, plus all apps have been updated to accept this new native resolution on the retina display.The 5 MP camera creates a great depth of fielt but obviously not as great as you'd see on a DSLR ;) It's as good as it gets mobile wise. Personally, I will not be using the iPad to take pictures as I laugh at people who use their tablets to take pictures, they look ridiculous.Good feel and size - I'm one of the rare few that likes their items to have a good weight to them because it proves that they have value to them, like pick up a Walmart watch then a Michael Kors watch and you'll know what I'm talking aboutDictation - It's nice and accurate, old technology, nothing to see here folks.Elegant looks - Of course it looks breathtaking compared to any tablet out there, it is sleek and simple.Cons:Still no smaller model, this is not a personal concern but yeah for all the whiners out thereStill no headphones - is it that hard to include them apple? Come on...A5X processor - You would think being a 1gb dual core with quad core graphics processor that it would blow the A5 out of the water? It actually got a point lower than the iPad 2 ( 720 vs 721) disappointing.To sum it up really, if you have an iPad 2, do not upgrade, if you have the original PLEASE do. If this is your first Apple tablet or first tablet at all, buy it. I say this because it is simple and straight forward, other tablets try to be so unique that they make everything a buggy mess and lag so much.

Content: Doesn't Work With All Wi-Fi. We got this as a gift.  The hardware seems nice, bright screen, good camera.The wi-fi worked fine at the hotel, but when we got home and turned on our own wi-fi, it would connect to the modem but not to the internet.  Our other computers have no problem connecting to our wi-fi but our Ipad 3 does.  Apparently it has a problem with WEP encryption and a future firmware update is supposed to tackle that issue, but for the moment we can't properly use it at home.There are other issues inherent to the ipad, such as the inability or difficulty in downloading a .pdf file, and any software you download has to go through apple's proprietary "app store", most of which costs money which apple gladly takes a slice.  Almost all the "apps" cost a few bucks, either that or they are adware, nagware, and the like.Anyhow, as far as surfing the net, reading books, or playing games like Angry Birds on it, it's a pretty neat device, but they do need to sort out their wi-fi issues.EDIT:  After updating software to 5.1.1 in May of 2012, our ipad now connects to our home wi-fi and internet without any problems. Changed rating from 2 to 3 stars.

Content: GREAT. I was using iPad 2 for long time, but after i use the new iPad, i surprised bcd of the retina screen, it's amazing, the only reason that i did not like it, the iPad temp. after you are using like 1 hour, you feel uncomforted. but overall, it's very good. and I got it in very short time, good packaging.

Content: It all depends on how you'll be using this device. From an Android based perspective, this device will get a 4-star if not 3-star for many reasons.  While loyal Apple fans or people who want to use the basic apps but appreciate its design you'll likely give it a 5-star.  So I had to go with the 4-star to be fair.Where the iPad 3 shines:- Gorgeous screen; not much complaint here as watching HD movies including Netflix and YouTube video is amazing- Thin & lightweight; for its size, it's not too big of a hassle to carry around- Beautiful design overall; Apple pretty much set a standard for today's tablets and they still keep simplicity in a beautiful design- Simple; you don't need to know how to use Apple products, great for kids and adults that aren't exactly tech savvy- Amazing battery life; I could play Minecraft for hours and don't eat up batteries like other tablets do- Very responsive; for the most part depending on the app.  Rarely freezes (yes, it still does freeze from time to time) and is fast enough to run any HD games and apps.Where iPad 3 doesn't impress:- No flash.  Flash enabled sites either need a flash compatible browser if not you cannot view the content.- No GPS for the Wifi version; this would annoy you if you're looking to use it for navigation (you'll need separate GPS module made by another company that cost at least $100)- Slow charging; with the wall charger it comes, it does charge very slow.  The only negative side of the longer lasting tablet- Keyboard is not intuitive; difficult to type in landscape mode, no swype or other after-market keyboard like Android has- Expensive; for the money you'd think you'll get more out of the unit- Screen size icons; for the massive screen, you don't have a way to cram more icons forcing you to either create folders within or use multiple screens.- Many apps that are free on Android market often times are not free on Apple Stores.- Proprietary plugs; when will Apple learn?  No HDMI, mini-USB, etc.I personally recommend the iPad Wifi version for:- General entertainment for games, movies and news reading + where Wifi is available- Children; easy to navigate and use- Don't care about GPS navigation or use it for related purpose- Are not tech savvy or don't mind not having flash options- Want something simple and reliable- Want long battery lifeI don't recommend the iPad Wifi version if you:- Want to use this in the car, boat or wherever you need a GPS for navigation and plotting- Want to do any sort of modification including custom ROM's- Need flexibility in terms of the O/S- Are looking for cost savings and best bang for your moneyPersonally I'm more of an Android guy than Apple guy but it doesn't mean Apple's products are bad either.  It's one beautiful tablet I've ever played around with (it's my wife's) and aside from it not having GPS and other features available on Android, it's a solid performer.On a personal note, if they come out with a 7" tablet I wouldn't mind owning one.  Especially if it had GPS even on the Wifi version I'd buy one in a heartbeat.  To me, the pro's outweigh the con's for the iPad 3.  For as long as I can remember I've been a PC-guy where I didn't care for Apple but ever since iPod's came out, they've really changed the computer industry.You won't regret your purchase either way.  Just take note of what's not on the device and what to expect.

Content: Not an Apple fan. I am not an Apple fan.  I got this Pad because I am a fan of the idea of "cloud" computing.  Basically I really like the idea of having minimal processor/memory on the machine.  Was hoping that Google's chrome book would catch on and I could skip the whole iPad thing but that hasn't happened.  As Stephen Colbert jokes you can't argue with the markets so I decided to get one.  I know Apple isn't listening but if I could improve the machine I would have a mouse option included, have a slightly larger (not smaller) screen model and try to make it work more as a computer and less as big phone- I really don't like opening websites and having them come up as the mobile version.  I'm keeping the iPad but it something better comes out(MS Surface?)or if a cloud net-book catches on this thing is going to my wife.

Content: Best Apple Ipad Ever! This Apple Ipad first generation is perfect for people who have kids. As a child with four siblings, I know this is true.  It is only about a few centimeters thick and can contain all the games you love, your calendar, the internet, and so much more. It isn't too small so that you can't read anything on it, but it isn't too big so you can take it places.  You can download games for the kids and have your apps also. My mom and dad will use the Ipad when they need to look something up or check the calendar. I love to play card games and watch movies on Netflix. Everyone in my family has their own app that they can always go on.  The only downside is how the internet connection is set up. My older siblings and I like to go on the internet to check our emails and facebooks. On the ipad first generation you can't get on the internet unless you have wifi. When we are on road trips we can't see what our friends are up to.  The people who wouldn't like this product would be people who need internet connection everywhere they go. That's alright because there is another ipad for that, but for me the Apple Ipad first generation is perfect for me.

Content: Sticking by my word. These are overpriced toys. First no support for Flash. This is a huge problem. How can you not support this? Is it being fazed out, yes, but not for a long time. The lack of Flash hurts a lot of the websites I have tried to go to.Next, their new maps support. These maps are terrible. Why kick the company to the curb that has already done all the work, put all the money needed into it, and is proven itself. Why? Apple has gotten a big head again, and believes that whatever it makes it just has to be better.Touch sensitivity: I used my friends iPad 2 for awhile after he upgraded to the iPad 3. He told me I had to try the new version. The touch sensitivity seems to be off. It does not have the response of the iPad 2, Samsung Tab, or even a Kindle I used to have.Retina display failure: I see no difference between the iPad 2 and the new iPad. If you are looking at upgrading to the new one for its display don't. There is nothing special about it. It is just a numbers game.Must use iTunes: iTunes is one of the main reasons I will never own an Apple product. This software is awful. I cannot believe they have not made it easier to use. If you want to buy all your stuff through apple then yes, oh yes they make it easier. But what if you are not brain wasted by apple and you want to use Amazon to get your music for a better price? Not so easy to get it on the iPad. The software is a joke.No support for other video formats. This device unlike all its competitors has said no to supporting standardized formats. If you are buying this device and wanting to transfer your current videos to it, don't. It will only support the apple format.Your apple ID: This is nearly the worst part of the iPad itself. You cannot do anything on the iPad without this ID. It is terrible, and if you forget your security questions you will need a crack team that can get into Fort Knox to get back in. Why are these questions so important? Well it took me over a month to help my mother fully get back into her apple ID because if you upgrade to a new apple product and you do not know those questions? Good Luck! You may never get back in. And if you have spent a lot of money in iTunes it could be lost. BEWARE: write down your security questions.So much for ease of use. I have had in the past year family come up saying with a big smile I just got the iPad. I tell them good luck with that. They go off and "play" with it for awhile. Then they come back and ask how to you download apps, how do you transfer music, how can you put DVD's I already own on it, how can I view this website it says flash not installed, and the list goes on. It took only about a month for one family member to ask me what is this good for then?I then smiled.I stand by my word. It is an overpriced toy.

Content: Perfect. Highly recommend.  If you're actually reading review on Amazon of this product... do yourself a favor because you're so on the fence.... buy an Amazon Kindle Fire (much cheaper)... use it for 6 months until your upset that you can't get all the same apps from your iPhone... by that time, this model will be two generations old and you can buy it for MUCH cheaper... maybe even save money after both purchases and still have two devices to show for it.

Content: Please read this if you think of buying: Ok, I would like to start by saying that the iPad that my wife got for me has no functional deficits. The reason I am assigning a "1 star" rating to this product is NOT because we bought a defective unit. Nor am I disappointed with the service: every time I went to the Apple Store to get help (and that happened a lot!), a perky 16-year-old would materialize out of thin air and show me how to press the only button available to make the gizmo work.But herein is the rub: if buying an iPad, any iPad, please be aware of its limitations. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A SMALL COMPUTER, WHAT I GOT WAS A LARGE CELL PHONE WITHOUT THE PHONE!PROs:-- it looks cool;-- my kids love it;-- yes, there are a lot of free apps in the AppStore;-- you can check your eMail pretty much anywhere and any timeCONs:-- many "free" iPad apps are "teasers;" i.e. they have limited functions and you have to pay to get a full version of these apps only to discover that they are often faulty;-- NO Java support-- NO Flash media support (although the iPad does come with a free YouTube app)-- NO preloaded apps that would let you manage Word-type documents or Excell-type spread sheets (you have to buy those but, again, once you do, you soon realize that they are nowhere close to the quality of the ones you use on your desktop [Mac or Windows])-- most importantly, there is NO ABILITY TO MANAGE YOUR OWN FILES! This one particular lacking feature drives me to distraction! There are several apps you can BUY that would allow you to manage your OWN files but, again, they are very poorly designed and often do not interact well with iTunes, Windows, or, surprisingly, iPad's own OS system .-- and here is another critical issue: EVERYTHING MUST BE SYNC'd via iTunes. If you are running a Windows desktop, this may be (and in my case indeed IS) a serious problem. Things purchased via iTunes, iStore, AppStore, etc, usually manage to get to your iPad unscathed. Other content (e.g. I am an eBook fan and purchase my eBooks in multiple places on the Net) are not so fortunate. Although, Apple's iBook app is free and allows you to use both .pdf and .ePub formats (you can also install a free Kindle app for .mobi books),  actually getting your books onto your iPad may be difficult, if not impossible. You cannot "drag-and-drop" your book files (or any other files) onto your iPad. Everything MUST BE SYNC'd with iTunes, an app called "DropBox," or some other app. If your iTunes does not get along with your desktop (usually a PROBLEM FOR WINDOWS users like me),  you will end up spending endless grim nights uninstalling iTunes, re-installing iTunes, wiping your iPad clean, sync'ing and re-sync'ing your iPad again, and again, and again.-- The Camera is OK, but keep in mind that all your videos will be in .mov format and may not play on all desktops --you will need a special converter to re-code the formats for non-Apple media players; you will need to install "Quick Time for Windows" on your desktop if you are running Windows.-- finally, there is noway to increase the amount of memory for the device as there is NO slot for a memory expansion card. I can't believe it! Every tablet has it BUT iPad. So you are pretty much stuck with 16 gB, 32 gB, or 64 gB tablet without ever having any hope of expanding!OVERALL :  I feel so bad that my wife spent all that money, time, and effort to get me this. I feel awful that her loving good intentions made us spend ~ $900 for something that turned out to be just an appallingly expensive toy, poorly engineered, thoughtlessly designed, and very frustrating to use. (The MSRP is ~ $600 - 700, but there are sales tax, additional warranty, front cover, back cover, USB attachments, and other apparel that one needs for this thing, hence the enormous price!)  The good thing is: it is possible to easily re-set it back to factory settings. And we still have the original box. I think it will make a great (and a VERY EXPENSIVE) Christmas gift for my in-laws. For Windows users (like me): please, think hard before sinking all that money into this purchase! Again, keep in mind, this is NOT a small and portable computer, IT IS ESSENTIALLY A SmartPhone WITHOUT THE PHONE!... just a bit bigger, though...

Does it all now with crystal, clear display.  Only negative is the screen has a slight light yellow tint over the previous models.  I - Pad is very addictive.  Can't put it down.

Content: It's amazing to live in the 21st century. I owned an iPod Touch prior to the iPad, which gave me a taste of the iPad's capabilities.  Now that I've experienced it, it's very hard to go back to using the Touch or even a laptop computer.  I worried initially about portability, but even with a sturdy case (which, as is typical of these delicate Apple products, is a must), it's no more bulky than a midsized hardcover book.  The graphics are crisp and beautiful and the wifi performance has thus far been flawless.  The battery life has been one of the biggest surprises thus far.  Even with moderate use, I only need to charge it twice a week.  It's amazing that everything I want is here at my fingertips--pictures, video, email, web browsing, music, games, and books.  Yes, books, another great suprise.  Reading books on iBooks or the free Kindle app is little different from reading a page of texts.  I had my doubts about this, but now I'm a believer, especially given the overwhelming amount of cheap or free ebook literature that's now available.  These are all things I only dreamed about as a kid some 30 years ago.  It is truly amazing to live in the 21st century.

Content: Absolutely fantastic! Couldn't be happier! I bought mine directly from Apple in May, 2012. I got the Wifi + Cellular model for AT&T; so I could have the internet anywhere and everywhere. I have used my iPad every single day and absolutely love it!I resisted getting an iPad for a long time because I could not see a need for one. I already had a MacBook Pro and an iPhone so what would I do with an iPad? It seemed to be a blown up version of the iPhone (without the phone part) and an inferior version of the MacBook Pro (without the keyboard or processing power). So what the heck would I do with this iPad thing?As it turns out, I do a lot with it! I will admit that I play games on it a lot, but I also use it as my main "to go" item. I have it synced with my MacBook Pro and iPhone so it always contains anything that I consider important and want to always take with me (emails, notes, calendars, documents of various kinds, etc). It's my entertainment if I'm ever stuck anywhere, having to wait on something (the apps are much better on the iPad than my iPhone). I keep track of the weather and my kids (AT&T;'s Family Map plan), and the rush hour traffic (which can be a mess in the Houston area). Maps are easier to read and follow with the larger screen than they were on my iPhone. Even reading books is better on the iPad than the iPhone. And, yet, it's easier to carry around than my MacBook Pro; plus, with the cellular contract, I always have the internet available to me at all times.So as it turns out, the iPad does have its place even though I have a MacBook Pro and an iPhone. They each have their specific purposes. Even though I waited years before finally buying my first iPad, I cannot imagine not having an iPad now. And I'm very pleased with the model I selected as it runs all the current software very well and should be able to keep up with whatever comes out in the future for a long time before it becomes so obsolete that I'll have to buy a newer version. Most definitely an excellent buy!

Content: Fast and awesome. I got this iPad about 3 weeks and I love it.  A lot faster on the Internet than iPad 1 & 2 I guess the processor are faster and newer.  The screen is much, much better compare to iPad 1 & 2 side by side...retina display is crystal clear in HD.  The only cons I guess is the iPad itself is a little hot after a long period of use.  Other than that the iPad is really great

I can literally do anything on this surf the web buy my ebooks for any & every single Ebook app I read a lot I put my audio books on play games email I even have movies .. My only con is the battery life isn't that great but I have chargers everywhere so that's not really an issue . I watch my dish anywhere with sling adaptor it's light enough just big enough I tried the mini & while it was super light the screen size wasn't for me

Content: Love my iPad. This is the first tablet computer I've purchased and I absolutely love it! I was warned that I couldn't play cd's or use a thumb drive so even thought that was a down side for me, I was prepared and don't really miss it. i also purchased and apple because of the quality of the product; I always seem to have trouble with IBM compatible computers. I downloaded books and have my iTunes music accessible, so I carry my iPad everywhere I go. In fact the only time I use my iPhone now is when I need to make a phone call or send a text. I haven't set up a data plan with my wireless provider yet since that's a little extra each month, but I will be breaking down and doing that because I do like having the option of using my iPad no matter where I am. The pictures and nice and big and clear (beautiful).The only down side is that you won't want to put it down!

Content: A hopped up semi-smart phone. PROSWell BuiltNice DisplayGood Touch screenCONSNO USB portEven at 64GB you don't have enough memory to do muchFront facing camera sucksRear facing camera is marginalNo zoom or flash on rear facing cameraNeeds aftermarket keyboard if you wish to type anything longer than a sentence or twoCharger get's VERY hot when you chargePOWER HOG - don't expect more than a few hours of video playback no matter what other people claim. And if you are using GPS and DATA streaming forget it, this thing sucks down the battery like crazy.Battery indicator lies - when it gets to 100% you are really at about 90%, keep charging for at least another 1-2 hours to get a full charge.Bottom LineIt's basically a hopped up smart phone with a bigger screen. Fun for face time, basic emails, watching YouTube videos or to play games but in reality it doesn't have enough computing power, memory or a functional keyboard to be useful as a mini-computer.EDIT: After Apple released the new IOS and it's subsequent update I have lowered my rating. NOT because the new IOS is bad but because of the stupid way it updates. Before you would update the IOS and the IOS only, now you have to completely wipe the IPAD's memory even for the littlest update (last one they added a Greek keyboard). That means you lose EVERYTHING on your IPad and you have to download it ALL again. That's right, every song, picture, app, data, video, magazine, kindle book, etc. etc. etc. But not before you have to input you Wi-Fi password (for every Wi-Fi account you use) and your apple account and password, not once but three times in order to even start using your IPad. For me to reprogram all of the passwords, restore all of the apps and re-download all of the data takes about 8 hours on a pretty high-speed connection of clicking on apps. This is CRAZY and for that reason alone it loses another star.Sorry apple the more I use your products the more infuriating they become.

Content: Great. Product arrived on time and was packaged very securely.  This was my second IPad and I was just as pleased with the newer version as the older one.  I use it for everything from grocery lists, to email and web surfing.  A great tool to help keep your life more organized.  I do see people without a cover,however, I highly recommend a good cover with the magnetic turn off when closed feature.  I recommend this product.  Apple products have been a change in my technical life that is better than I even imagined.

If you have ever used another tablet (like an android) you will appreciate how easy to use an ipad is. I would recommend protecting this device with a case like the Griffin so that the ipad will work for a long time to come. This device is a very versatile tool!

Content: Love it. I do a lot of cross country Harley riding and needed something that could handle the needs of an extended trip, i.e. banking, weather, hotel reservations, communications with the home front etc.but smaller and more packable than a lap top.  This is my first experience with an Apple product and it has exceeded expectations in both capabilities and durability.  The picture taking and sending features are particularly good.  Facetime is a lot of fun as well.  Love it...

Content: Love at first sight! This is the first iPad I have owned, and was skeptical about spending so much money. I had tried out other people's iPads, and was really happy with how they ran, and thought it was much better than any android tablet on the market. Long story short, I got a great deal on the iPad, and went for it. First impressions were, well, love at first sight. The iPad has a great hd retina screen, which offers a very eye pleasing viewing experience. Boot time was very fast, and setup took less than 2 minutes. I am very happy with the options that come bundled wth the iPad, such as find my iPad, iTunes, and iCloud. Apple support has been fantastic as well. One call or email has been enough to answer all of my questions. Overall, the value of this iPad can not be found in any other tablet on the market. If you are thinking about the iPad, read the features, and all of the positive reviews. I promise you will not be disappointed with your iPad.

Content: The best 9.7 inch tablet I have ever used! What's included?The device is packaged nicely and the box includes the iPad charger rated at 2.1 Amps at 5.1 VDC. It also includes a USB to iPad cable for use with the power supply and it also interfaces with your computer to connect to iTunes. The cable is only 41 inches long which is always one of my pet peeves because when you plug the charger in the wall the cable is too short to allow you to reach to the top of a dresser for example and charge the product at night. The first thing you will do is buy a USB male to female extender cable or buy the Apple extended version charger at $29 cost to charge the unit properly.You also get a one page instruction card that basically says to turn on the unit and follow the directions. You also get the important product information guide and two white apple logos to use as you desire.Set up* Turn it on and select your language and touch next.* Select your country and touch next.* It will ask you if you want to have the unit identify the location of where you are at. Select yes as this is important for later tracking of the device if it is stolen.* Activate networks, which in my case was only WIFI. Select your SSID from the list of possible connections, enter in your password, if your network is protected. Touch next.* Activate your Apple ID using your e-mail address and your Apple password.* Accept the Apple terms.* It will then start a set up.* It asks if you want to use the cloud option for communication and uploading and downloading.* It asks if you want to use the dictation mode when you touch the microphone on the keyboard.* The iPad then does some diagnostics and loading.* It asks you if you are ready to register the product with Apple.* It then tells you that you are ready to use the iPad.Attach the unit to your computer that has iTunes installed, (make sure you are using the latest version):* When you plug in the iPad it asks if you want to set it up as a new iPad or to use the data of an existing iPad. I selected New iPad.* It asks you to select an iPad name. Make sure that it is unique so that you don't confuse iTunes into thinking you have two devices with the same name.* The iPad is set to auto sync and I stopped that as my music files are to large for the 64 GIG memory. I select only the music, videos, and photos I want to sync.* The unit will begin to sync your data and it will install all of your existing apps you own as long as you have not exceeded the limit of 5 Apple devices using those apps.* Your apps are all loaded as single apps and if you want you have to combine them into folders and name the folders. This took me about an hour as we own over 200 apps. The list was 10 pages long.* I then told the iPad to sync with my contacts, calendar and with two email accounts using Outlook. Don't forget you will have to enter in your ISP email account password for each email account you sync with before your e-mail will be down loaded.* All of these steps occurred without error and they happened very quickly. This unit is faster than the iPad 2 device and it clearly shows while processing these steps.Installing Kindle Reader app.* I use the Kindle reader app a lot and it was already installed above by the app installation process.* Touch the Kindle app and it will ask you for your Amazon ID and password. Almost instantly it tells you that you can look at your books in the Cloud and you will start to load up the book covers. Each cover will have a downward pointing arrow on it to indicate that it has not been downloaded to your device.* Touch each cover and the book will download. I have a very good WIFI and each book only took seconds. I own about 350 Kindle books and the process was very fast. You can touch 10 to 15 books and it will download them sequentially and very quickly.* When you are reading a book and want to look up a word in the dictionary, the first time it will ask you if you want to download the dictionary to your device. Select yes and it takes about 5 seconds to do this. Look up of words is virtually instantaneous.* You will notice the outstanding quality of the display as the text looks like a printed page with perfect resolution and dark text. It is impressive!Find iPhone* Touch the Find iPhone icon* Enter in your Apple ID and Password and touch Go.* The application will then locate all of your Apple devices assigned to your account. You can now look at each location either on a map or even a satellite view. If your iPad does not show up then go to settings and touch Location Services and turn on Find My iPad and Status Bar Icon. You will be able to locate your device within about 10 to 20 feet!* It is critical that you set this up as you can now track your device if it is lost or stolen!* You can also make the missing device, Play a Sound, Remote Lock, Remote Wipe, and even allow it to send you an e-mail when the device is found.SecurityThis is one of Apple's shining stars regarding security. By touching settings for example you can set Auto-Lock to on, select a Passcode Lock and set restrictions. By doing this you can lock your iPad with a simple or more complex passcode (recommended) so that if it is stolen you will not lose your data to a hacker. Under restrictions the list is 21 items long. You can give this device to a child and turn off the web browsing, social networks, buying games and products, dictation, installing and deleting apps, etc...This product is professionally designed and if you are giving this to a child (or even giving them an iPod) you can lock these features and feel secure that they have access to only the things you want them to have. You can even assign age limits for music, shows, movies, apps, etc.. It is the best security setup available today.Web browsingUnbelievably fast! This is where the strength of the new processor shows and the speed of the WIFI connection is wonderful. It is virtually as fast as my 1GHz wired Ethernet connected computer. The streaming of video is fast and flawless.Face TimeThe advantage of having a front and rear facing camera is that you can call anyone using a iPhone 4 or iPad 2 or the new iPad and talk to them and see them simultaneously if they are connected to a good WIFI connection. The new cameras on this iPad are 5 Mega pixels and you will see the difference immediately. The video and picture are extremely clear.Face Time is very nice and if you want you can even swap camera front to back so instead of the person you called seeing you they can see what you are seeing. This is a very nice and powerful feature.TypingTyping is smooth and fast. You cannot type with two thumbs (as the screen is too wide) and it is better to rotate the device to landscape mode and get a good sized keyboard to type on. I can almost type as fast on the iPad as I can on a full size computer keyboard.E-mailThis set up immediately and downloaded 50 e-mails into each account in about a minute. The e-mail system is easy to use and to respond on. It set up two email accounts for me in about 1 minute to set up and 1 minute to download the 50 e-mails.AppsApple has the best app store in the market. Amazon is getting better but Apple has a head start. Literally, "There is an app for that!" is not a joke but a reality. All of my 200 apps loaded via iTunes in about 20 minutes and we have a lot of them.CameraThe new 5 Megapixel camera is very nice. The quality is instantly recognizable in every photo and video you take. You actually record video in 1080P HD quality and between the camera and the display you will be amazed at how good the result is.There is no flash on the camera so that is an issue in low lighting.One of the advantages of the iPad is the number of high quality apps that can be used to tweak your photographs and make them look professional. We own several of these apps and the results can be spectacular. You can literally make a professional looking photography show using these apps and with this improved camera the results will even be better.Dictation and microphoneUsing the iPad Notes function you can touch the microphone on the keyboard and dictate to the iPad. I dictated this paragraph and it translated it to text with fewer typing errors than I did while typing this section. After you finish dictation, just retouch the microphone on the keypad and the voice recording will be converted to text.FacebookSet up of Facebook was fast and easy. Just enter your e-mail address and then your Facebook Password and you are on line. The quality of the pictures looks much better on the display as long as the person who set them up used a high quality photo.iTunes music and moviesI have input every CD and audio book I own into iTunes. I also have loaded MP4 movies into iTunes and they can be played on the iPad with very good results. They literally are HD quality. I purchased a 64 GIG version white iPad 3 to have the space to load as much music, photos, and videos as I can onto the device and use it for an entertainment center. I loaded 200 apps at 9.5 GIG and 350 Kindle books and I still have almost 48 GIG of free memory left for my other items!GamingI won't spend a lot of time here but just to say that we all know that the Apple products have some of the best gaming apps available. They vary from action games, sports games, strategy games, puzzle games and tower defense style games. Make sure that you buy the HD version of the games for the iPad in order to take advantage of the new display features.DisplayThe 9.7 Retina Display; 2048 x 1536 resolution produces razor sharp pictures and text. You simply have to see it to believe it. This screen has 3.1 million Pixels and is powered by a quad core graphics chip. The first three things I noticed were the quality of the pictures and videos and the text is crisper and darker.BatteryThis design has up to 10 hours of battery life even with all of these features. This makes the Apple iPad a truly enjoyable device when you know that you can listen to music, read, watch videos and work on photos for 10 hours and not have to worry about recharging or being tied to a power cable.Cons* No flash on the camera.* No 7" tablet available for a lower price and portability.* Power and connection cable 41" long, way too short in my opinion.* High price, demanded by the quality but still a gulp when you buy one!

Content: Great at what it is intended to do. If you like reading books, watching TV shows or Movies, and playing games, then this device is perfect. However, the Ipad was never intended for serious office work or as a portable storage device, so be informed up front, this tool will not replace your laptop or even your netbook due to its limitations.That said, I have used it to display PowerPoint presentations and to do light office work. But when it comes to editing or performing actual day-to-day work related tasks, this device is simply not capable of performing much (if any of them) without jumping through tons of hoops for every new project.This shouldn't matter if you use this tablet for it's intended function: to entertain you.PROS: The construction is second to none. Processor speed is excellent. Huge library of Apps. Long battery life. And fairly simple to use. The speaker is also pretty decent.CONS: It can be a pain to upload files. ITunes is the worst program I've ever used. The back is way too smooth to get a grip on (basically, you NEED a case/cover to actually hold onto this device with any sense of security). Accuracy with a stylus isn't that great; only the most talented artists are capable of using this as a drawing tablet and your handwriting will never look worse than it does on this device.Even with the amount of cons, I can't stop using this tablet when I'm away from the computer.And depending on where you live, a wifi version should be sufficient when out and about. I've rarely had difficulty finding a hot spot at any destination I've travelled to.

Content: OWNED IPAD 1, 2 AND NOW 3. No long review or repeat of specs here...Weight and size are virtually unnoticeable although its a bit thicker.....Fits in the original iPad 1 case. I've used this case for all three iPads....It does run a bit hot....  Processor is faster.. Screen is very very clear....Still slow battery charge and NO FLASH player.... I would not have purchased iPad 3 but the company I work for gives us points to spend each quarter and had enough points to purchase this iPad....It's really quite nice.....iPad 2 resale is a no brainer.  Just tell everyone at work you want to sell your iPad...It takes about a day.  eReaders are for old folks (because they actually know how to read) nothing compares to an iPad.  Other tablets are just wanna be's......I have enjoyed owning iPad...I use it with a Verizon Samsung 4g LTE.... at Dr's appt.'s, at lunch, during break time, at work.....They slowly keep getting better and better..

Content: I was hooked...!! I went to BB to tinker with the Galaxy Tab 2 and the Asus Prime. I was definitely going to order one of those. I had ABSOLUTELY no intention of even considering an iPad. I have always had Android in my phones and wasn't about to change now.As I played with these two tablets, I noticed the pros/cons as stated by reviewers. My complaint with the Galaxy was the bit of lag, especially in the browser... but it was doable. The Prime just flat out disappointed me with it's non-bright display. I thought that someone put the display settings down but it was on high. I tried another one thinking that maybe this was defective and I got the same dark(er) screen. Also had the same lag time. Was also scared about the wi-fi issues I had heard about. And wi-fi is the main reason I am purchasing a tablet.For the hell of it I looked at the iPad 3 since it was right next to these. I immediately saw a huge difference in resolution. The more I studied it the more I was blown away. I went back and forth comparing the text resolution to the other two and there is NO comparison. The text on the iPad 3 is just crystal clear and as sharp as can be. You can even see the difference between the iPad3 & iPad2. While looking at small text I had to zoom in a little to read it with the Androids but with the Ipad 3 I could leave it at it's smallest text and read it easily.Also there was NO lag at all in the browser. It flowed smoothly with no hiccups or lags. After seeing this I went back to the Galaxy and now I can realllly notice the lag. Scrolling through web pages it was choppy and hesitant (in comparison).When pinching the pages, it would jump a bit and go down a few lines. With the IPad 3, no jumping at all. Pinching was extremely smooth and perfect. I have been converted!!Yes, I would love to have the Android personilization, but better graphics and smoothness are more important to me. The other tablets just can't compare in this department. I am a convert.Note - Give careful consideration as to the storage size you need. I was going to get the 16GB model and although I do not do many games, I was concerned about running out of space. If the iPad allowed you to use an SD card, then the 16GB would have been my choice; but I stepped up to the 32GB model to play it safe. Currently I have only a few games and about 4 apps. I have NO photos or music on here yet and already I have taken up almost 4GB of space. Obviously pre-installed material contributed to this but I would recommend that you consider the size carefully. If you will be saving movies, music and large photos, it may be wised to consider the 32gb model.

Content: The new Ipad 3. I have had the new Ipad for almost 3 weeks now. I've downloaded lots of apps, use it for business meetings, play HD games on it, take pictures in different settings, use it to stream videos, watch my own videos on it, do some ppt presentations on it, use MSWord and Excell documents on it, read some iBooks on it, put the battery into constant abuse to see how long it last and I gotta tell ya, I'm pretty much impressed! But I do have a few cons about this tablet. And now I will list my pros and cons below.PROS & CONS:1.  Retina display is stunning! I have view wallpapers, photos, videos(my own uploaded & streaming)and it looks incredibly sharp and crisp.  I have some photos that were taken during a trip to SF Bay a few months back and forgot to bring my Cannon DSLR camera so we took some pictures with my wife's little samsung handheld 8mp camera.  When these photos loaded onto my laptop they look ugly, blurry, and pixelated but when I had them transfer to the new Ipad to view...wow they look great (not amazing, but great). The retina display help the photos to shine!  I've also uploaded the movie "The Lorax and Acts of Valor" to the new Ipad and even at 720p, the pictures looks stunning.  Then I stream movies from Netflix and Amazon and the pictures looks even more stunning.  Last week we went to a hiking trip and I took some pictures with the Ipad's camera.  I was a little skeptical due to the fact that it didn't have a built in flash, but when I view the pictures both on the new Ipad and my laptop, I was amazed how good the pictures look (it makes me wanted to take it to walmart and have it printed).  I even test the display laying down and try viewing from the side and the picture still looks stunning.  Overall, the Retina display on the new Ipad is topnotch and you will love it! Definately a PRO!2.  Performance wise, the Ipad is a quard core (4X) processor and with only 1g of internal graphics memory I don't really have much issues with it.  I have had a few crashes with some apps but I believe it's due to the app.  I have run apps that are processor hungry such as Air Supremacy and Garageband without a glitch.  I know with any tablet, you will experience some problems and the Ipad 3 is no exception.  I only wish apple put a 6 cores and 2g of memory inside but that would up the price too. Neither PRO or CON.3.  Responsiveness, the touch screen response pretty quick with my fingers but I'm using a stylus pen and depends on how hard the tip of your stylus pen is sometimes the screen won't register.  You will need to push a little harder. Still a PRO!4.  Productivity, with any tablet you buy it because you want it to use it for work and play, right?  Well, I have work with the new Ipad and play with it and this is how I feel.  I've used it to take notes during a meeting (I'm the notetaker) using just the app "Note" with a bluetooth keyboard and I was able to keep up with the meeting.  Pretty impressive! I have use it to give out speeches using ppt slideshow and able to use and edit MSWord on the tablet.  Even if I have to use third party apps to be able to use ppt and words, it runs great and very impressive!  I've used the tablet to remote controll my laptop and wow it runs smoothly without a glitch.  I was able to download some of the files I needed to my new Ipad within minutes!  You can access ONLive, Dropbox, etc. on the tablet without any issues.  Reading on the new Ipad is great also.  The letters on the screen is truly crisp, clear and sharp and I gotta say it's the best compare to any tablet on the market now (Even with the new Asus Infinety TF700).  PLAYTIME! Games, Games and Games!  I've downloaded tons of games, bowling, Angry birds, hockey, fruit ninja, pool, DH reloaded, Riptide, Dark Me, FLcommando, Dead Trigger, Juggernaut, GT HD, Air Supremacy, Metalstorm, F18 Carrier, Gunships, Blood and Glory, Infinety blade, and many more that I've played and deleted.  The games looks stunning on the new Ipad and it plays well (especially Air Supremacy, wow you gotta check out the graphics on that game!). THIS IS MOST DEFINATELY A PRO!5.  Well, every tablet has it goods and bads and it's no exception for Apple's new Ipad.  I have the screen brightness at "AUTO" and in my opinion I don't think the battery lasted long enough. It lasted about 6.5 to 7 hours for me.  This made me want to get the Asus Infinety TF700 with the keyboard dock.  I went to bestbuy to ask them why didn't the new Ipad support flash and they gave me a bunch of bullship excuses.  Well it's APPLE! They want to be different!  I really wish that my wallpapers could be a moving background like all the android tablets.  NO ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS - a bummer for me!  NO microSD card slots, HDMI, or anything else except your power button, wake, and volume buttons.  And it will cost me an arm and a leg to get accessories/adapters for the new Ipad to be able to stream (HDMI) movies to my HD TV, shoot my ppt presentation on a screen, transfer photos/videos to and from my new Ipad.  And most of all, I can not expand my internal storage cuz NO microSD card!  I bought (well...my wife bought it for me.  What a nice wife I have!) the 32g Ipad and with all the apps, movies, videos, photos I have already I'm down to 7g of memory left.  Darn! should have told her that I wanted the 64g!6.  Other CONS that I have are, IT GETS HOT! as hot as my 3 year old laptop.  The new Ipad can be a heater for winter (although the new Ipad might freeze during winter).  Do not put your Ipad in the car!  It does not like heat!  Even under the seat it will overheat, it likes to breath just like you and me.  It's like why would you lock your animal or kids in a warm summer car.  Same concepts here people! why would you lock your Ipad in a hot summer car.  When you play intense games or run application hungry apps it will get hot and you will notice it.  Another gripe, I mean CON.  What $#R@# is the use of a facing camera that takes pictures or video that looks like VHS quality.  All these tablet companies that have a little wimpy low resolution facing camera on their tablet need to go and do more research.  If you're willing to put a 8MP camera on the back might as well put one in the front.  I want to look stunning when I facetime with friends and family.  It's an advertisement gig! LOOK GOOD on camera to show the world they will come and buy your product!  PUT a decent camera on the front!7. And LAST but not LEAST!  I was very happy that the next system upgrade on the new Ipad, Apple will finally have SIRI on the new Ipad.  Well...at least I will have a woman to talk to when my wife is not home.  I just hope Apple don't use a man instead! better yet, give options to choose man or woman or an alien.  I guess, after all the PROS and CONS and gripes it all comes down to one last question.  DO I RECOMMEND PEOPLE TO BUY THE NEW IPAD 3?  Yeah...yeah! If you have the cash ($499 and up) or if you have a beautiful and very nice wife that would buy one for you.  " GO AHEAD MAKE YOUR DAY! YOU WON'T BE DISSAPPOINTED! "

Content: Love It!!! I bought this for my 54 yr old husband who is "TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGED". He struggles with texting on his cell phone...for heavens sake! If there is any kind of problem with computers, phones or internet, I have to figure it out.I bought this tablet for him and he absolutely loves it! A chimpanzee can use it. There are no user manuals that he has to read...just turn it on. He carries it everywhere.I researched pricing and Amazon.com was the best deal by far PLUS it arrived in 3 days! Amazing! I would highly recommend the IPAD for anyone who gets overwhelmed with technology and even for grandparents (it has skype)! It is worth the money!

Content: Love it! I received my iPad 3 recently. Having never had one ths is my first.  I read all the reviews, over and over.  Finally decided to go ahead and buy.  I amm so happy with  my ipad3!  I only have 2 complaints...... #1..... It should come with a manual to help you learn how to use it.  I have an iPhone 4 and thought it would be like that....it is not.  #2..... I cannot use message the way I do on the iPhone....and I did sign up for the data plan. I called Apple to find out why it does not operate the same as the iPhone.  I will probably cancel the data plan before my month is up. Unless someone can give me a reason to keep it.Other than these 2 issues I am happy with the ipad3.

Content: Love it! This is my first iPad and I love it!! I take it with me almost everywhere and it is great for school. I use the byki app for my Russian class to help me study and the kindle app is useful for school books also. My only fault with this is that I should have bought one with more memory.i've had this less than a month and already the memory Is full. There is an option to buy more memory yearly but I just decided to delete all my music instead.

Content: The best for households. Ipad is the best for the house for its easy carrying and slim design. You need to get a cover case since these will get damaged if you drop them. It is easy to use and processes things fast. The wi-fi works ok but could be better

Content: Can not be replaced with the MacBook Air. As much as I liked my iPad 1, I thought MacBook Air 11 would be a more practical choice in term of upgrade. However, very soon after buying MacBook Air and giving my iPad 1 away I realized that I really missed my iPad (another thing I thought would help me to deal without it was a 4.5 LG Spectrum Phone).I was concerned about the New iPad being a bit more bulky than iPad 2 and getting warm as some people complained. Waiting until a new version of iPad is released seemed like a good idea, but I decided to go for it and buy the New iPad anyways. No regrets: it is not bulkier than my older ipad 1, and even though I do feel the warmth on its back and wish it was not there, the high resolution screen makes up for it and would probably compensate for more problems if there were more ones.The iPad definitely has the niche of its own: as small as MacBook Air 11 is, it is not the same. New iPad has a way better screen, nicer form factor (for reading and for browsing), and does not get overheated as quickly (my MBA would turn its fan almost right away as I start watching a video on it). If you have to compromise and have only one device, MBA is a better choice of course because it is a computer, not a mobile device. But as a second device iPad works really well.

Content: Siri is the difference between Ipad and the rest. The new iOS 6 for Ipad has just been released, so I will talk about it.YouTube is not a pre-loaded app anymore, but you can now see Youtube videos directly in Safari.Siri is the voice command interface for Apple. You can ask Siri the result of the latest game and Siri will answer. It works very well, but it lacks support. I tested it asking the result from a soccer game in which Manchester United had played yesterday and it gave me the result from last weekend.However, when I asked about a pizza place near my home, it gave me 15 options and with just one click it began giving GPS directions for me to get there. It was great!Siri dictation can even write notes or send e-mails for you!This feature alone makes Ipad great for students or professionals who need to take quick notes or need remainders.I tried to open many games with voice command, but Siri identified only half of them. There should be a way to teach Siri the names of your favorite app (I love Draw Something and Siri did not identified it). It might be because I am using Siri in Spanish, maybe it has more support in English, but I don't know how to change language setting!Anyway, Ipad is the best tablet in the market. It is great for Kids because it has lots of games, the screen shows beautiful colors and the screen responds to light or hard touch very well.Teenagers will love social apps integration such as Facebook or Twitter, they can share photos in an easy way. Flipboard looks great on Ipad!I know it is expensive but it is worth it.

Content: If you are not from USA or major EU countries... A word of caution for those from 3rd world countries and from some non-major EU countries like mine -- if you are interested in buying an iPad first check that your country is on a list of supported countries in iTunes Store.If it isn't, your only option to get additional software and multimedia content on it will be to jailbreak it. Moreover, if Amazon Payments or Paypal don't work for you either making even Cydia Store unusable, your only source of applications will be pirated stuff from the shady Internet corners. Note that I am not advocating piracy -- I am merely presenting the choices you will have if you cannot select your country in iTunes Store.During my last visit to San Francisco I have purchased Apple iPad 3 (16GB, WiFi, white) in an Apple Store. I paid for it using my VISA credit card issued in Serbia with absolutely no issues. However, iTunes Store will not accept the very same credit card because I cannot enter valid billing address -- my country is not on the list.I exchanged several emails with Apple Support, but the only thing they were able to tell me is that my country is not currently supported and that they will eventually support it some day.Now I have a great piece of hardware which is useless except for very basic stuff -- email (a trivial client for people who get at most 1 email per day and delete it after reading), surf (if you can stand the ads because there is no ad blocker in Safari), social networks, some PDF documents, and that's about it.Thanks to Apple, I cannot purchase software, books, music, movies, tv shows, nothing. So, my advice to you is -- do your homework before purchasing. I admit that I didn't, because I haven't expected that in this day and age of e-banking and e-commerce someone is still discriminating credit cards by the country of issuance.

Content: WiFi issues. Had my iPad 3 for probably 6 months, having bought the first and second generation ones previously.  The WiFi got slower and slower.  Had Verizon out to my home for 1/2 a day - they checked everything.  Ipad worked fine for another month then WiFi slowed to a crawl.  My wife's Ipad 2 continues to have no WiFi problems. This appears to be a problem with iOS6 - it is well documented at the large company I work for.  No more Apple products for me.

Content: Deceptive title- you get what you pay for. As noted elsewhere, the newest IPad (commonly known as the Ipad 4) is called "IPad with Retina display" by Apple. IMPORTANTLY, it has a souped up A6X processor... look it up. The so-called IPad 3 has a much slower A5X processor. There are other minor changes between 3 and 4 but this is the big one. Guess what... this listing for the "Latest Model" at a great price specifies that it has an A5X processor. Look at the description. This doesn't add up. It appears that they are selling an Ipad 3 to people that believe they are buying a cheap IPad 4. Be careful out there!

Content: Used is the way to go! I got this from one of the used resellers.  I have to say, I would never know that this was a used product.  It can in original packaging like new.  And I saved close to $200 going this route.  I replaced my ipad first gen with this one just so I can get the new IOS versions and use Facetime.  Since this does not have the new Lightning connection, all of my old charging cables and other accessories still work and now I can also enjoy the new Retina display.So anyone else looking to move from 1st gen iPad to new, unless you need the new processor or need 4G/LTE then iPad 3 is for you.  And save yourself the money by buying used from one of the Amazon resellers.

Content: Not New!! Be very careful when ordering an iPad 3rd generation.  They aren't New!  I started to unpack the one I ordered and I am now in the process of returning it.  How I found out is I watched 4 videos online of people unpacking a new one.  In all 4 videos the ipad 3, itself was wrapped with some sort of cellophane.  Mine didn't have any wrapping around it!  I, also, found out they are discontinuing making them. I really wanted one.  If you look closely at the ad on Amazon nowhere does it say it is new!! BUYER BEWARE!!  I called an Apple store nearby me and they do still have some "REAL" new ones in their store for $499. Another thing that bothered me is there was no packing slip in the shipping box from Amazon that the iPad 3 came in. That never has happened to me before when ordering from Amazon. I've ordered many big ticket items from Amazon in the past and I never had a problem before.  Now it's the hassle of returning it, getting a credit on my credit card, and then purchasing a "NEW" iPad 3 from the Apple store. From now on I will be very wary of ordering from Amazon (if I ever do), even though they have good deals.

Content: Amazingly Just As Described. I received my item within 2 days of my order, which I thought was very nice, the item is exactly as described, it is FLAWLESS with a sort of deep mark on the back, which is okay because it will always be cased anyway. I would of given it a 5 star, but I don't like the fact the I got the small charger which take 4ever to charge and I don't think that they are original APPLE PRODUCT. But so far its working good, and it was kept in exceptional condition.

Speaker should broadcast towards front. Apple sacrificed beauty (?) for sense. So bad they have after market solutions: http://www.amazon.com/tabAmp-iPad-Amplifier-Enhancer-Booster/dp/B008AS2TM6/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topThis is my first iPad, so I cannot speak to other generations.

Content: Love my iPad. This is the first tablet computer I've purchased and I absolutely love it! I was warned that I couldn't play cd's or use a thumb drive so even thought that was a down side for me, I was prepared and don't really miss it. i also purchased and apple because of the quality of the product; I always seem to have trouble with IBM compatible computers. I downloaded books and have my iTunes music accessible, so I carry my iPad everywhere I go. In fact the only time I use my iPhone now is when I need to make a phone call or send a text. I haven't set up a data plan with my wireless provider yet since that's a little extra each month, but I will be breaking down and doing that because I do like having the option of using my iPad no matter where I am. The pictures and nice and big and clear (beautiful).The only down side is that you won't want to put it down!

I use it for everything from grocery lists, to email and web surfing.  A great tool to help keep your life more organized.  I do see people without a cover,however, I highly recommend a good cover with the magnetic turn off when closed feature.  I recommend this product.  Apple products have been a change in my technical life that is better than I even imagined.

Content: Seller advertised iPad as new- 1 Year Warranty expired  3 months ago. Cellular Data stopped working. After numerous attempts to solve with ATT finally brought it into an Apple Store.Apple Tech informed me it was hardware issue and would have to be replaced. No problem, I just got this 3 months ago, iPads have a 1 year limited warrantyTurns out the warranty EXPIRED June 1st 2013., 2 months before I bought it, and the seller completely failed to include that very important bit of information.Nice.

Content: The only option for aviation apps. I bought my iPad 3 for using aviation apps in my airplane. The aviation apps available these days are simply amazing. I no longer have to carry a big case full of charts and approach plates. It's all available on my iPad. Plus the location of my airplane is shown right on the chart or approach plate in real time. I can get 15 minute old weather including radar and satellite showing right on the chart. And with the 4G active I get updates in the air as long as I'm not in the mountains too far from a cell tower on the ground. The FAA and airlines have been crazy careful about passengers using cell phones in airliners. I can use my cell connection on my iPad for real time updates while in the air. For aviation usage the iPad is wonderful.That said, I use the iPad at home for reading the NY Times and responding to email. I have a Logitech bluetooth keyboard/cover that perfectly integrates with the iPad. I also use the iPad for displaying textbooks in the Amazon Kindle app. I can use the iPad for a laptop replacement for domestic pleasure trips. But for international travel the iPad is not very useful. For business trips there's no real replacement for a laptop when you need to use PowerPoint to make presentations or work with large spreadsheets or documents. The iPad is for light duty only. And it has no video connection for attaching a projector. HDMI is available using an adapter. But it's not well integrated. I see folks using an iPad for reading a book on an international flight or watching a movie. But a Kindle is much better suited for book reading on long flights. And bigger Android phones work perfectly well for watching movies. Taking an iPad on an international trip where it's a major target for thefts is really not the best idea.This iPad is the best option for what I use it for - aviation. So I can highly recommend getting an iPad for aviation. Make sure you get a WiFi 4G model. The WiFi only models do not have built in GPS.  I've tried the few apps available for aviation on Android. But they are much less capable than the iPad versions and there is really only one app choice - Garmin :Pilot. If you're in the Apple world and need a tablet then the iPad is a logical choice. But if you're in the Android world and don't need aviation apps, then the Galaxy Note 8.0 or the Galaxy Tab Pros are very good tablet choices.

Content: My First Tablet - a hdtv in your hand. I was almost considering the iPad2 for portability but ended up getting  an 11inch macbook air last year.  Yet with all the convenience a tablet has over a  laptop  I've been waiting for this retina screen and pre ordered  my first tablet a Black 16Gb 4G At&t; on the first day of release. Glad to have skipped the earlier 2 Gen's of iPad.With just few hours  of usage, I realized how convenient it is for everyday browsing and entertainment.  Retina screen really made a huge difference.  It truly appears like an hdtv in your hand. Definitely recommend buying it. For some reasons I've always  tried to stay away from  Apple products due to their higher  price etc.,  But over years, I find myself  accumulating Apple products  starting with my first purchase a 3rd gen Nano to  this current iPad 3.  I feel their products  are really designed for convenience, there is so much attention given to minor  things that other brands do not care about.  This factor alone makes me forget about their price.

Content: I finally succumbed... ...and bought an iPad last week.  My first Apple product.  So far, I like it a lot.  Glorious colors, very fast downloads, enormous app store, I felt like a kid let loose in a candy shop.  I haven't had any problems with "warm spots" or "hot spots" either.  But it's not an unmixed blessing.For one thing, it's pretty heavy to carry around.  Walking 20 blocks toting an iPad in my tote bag is not the best experience I've ever had.  A smaller tablet comes in handy at times like that.For another, some apps and websites don't work as well on Apple as they do on Android.  Notable among these is Nook.  (I know nothing about Kindle because I've never used it.)  I have Nook for Android on my HTC phone and every feature works great.  There is no Nook store on Nook for iPad; to download books from Nook you have to go to the Barnes&Noble; website, navigate to NookBooks, and order from there.  Another minor cavil is that Nook for iPad doesn't have animated page-turning whereas Nook for Android does.  However, I didn't have any problem downloading my Nook library to my iPad; in fact, as soon as the app was installed, all my books downloaded immediately.  (Reading books, of course, is a lot easier on an iPad than on a cell phone because the screen is so much bigger.)The iPad bookstore is adequate; that's the most I can say for it.  It's nowhere near as comprehensive as NookBooks.  So far I've got 3 books on my iPad bookshelf and over 30 on my Nook bookshelf.I clicked on the Huffington Post website on my iPad.  Lousy scrolling and none of the comments loaded.  iPad has an app called HuffPo for iPad so I downloaded that and found out the videos don't load properly.  C'mon, Apple, you can do much better than that.  I haven't had any problem with any of the other websites I've navigated to so far.I was able to transfer all my photos and videos from my cell phone to my iPad with no problem at all.Actually, my biggest beef with the iPad is that the screen is a fingerprint magnet.  No, this screen is NOT fingerprint-resistant, I don't care what anyone tells you.  Five minutes in and the screen is absolutely covered with fingerprints.  The screen  protector for the iPad 3 is okay and solves about 95% of the fingerprint problem.  The smart cover is great for saving energy and keeping the screen free of dust and scratches.  Naturally the screen protector costs extra, but they did apply it for me at the AT@T store.  Good thing, too, or I would have gone bananas trying to get out the air bubbles.  Actually they did a commendable job.I bought the iPad with 4G from AT&T; because I don't have wi-fi at home and don't want to be limited to a wi-fi hotspot if I want to surf the internet.  The day AT&T; set my account up, the iPad worked perfectly until around midnight and all of a sudden it wouldn't connect to the server.  Next morning, it was working fine and continued to work all day with no problems until late that night when it wouldn't connect again.  I took it back to the AT@T store the following day and they told me AT&T; was having some server problems which should be fixed by that evening.  They were.  No connection problems since then.Overall, the iPad is a lot of fun.  I'm still exploring all the various apps it comes with (I absolutely love the Photo Booth) and getting used to how it works.  It's not perfect, but what is?Judy Lind

Content: Waited to enter 2 centavos... I am coming from an original ipad. For the first six months I barely used that thing, rarely engaged the 3g service. Then one day I used it to study new engineering texts... Then started to read science articles while outside the house, and write emails to collegues during downtime. I am now addicted like a twelve year old girl. I bought a red alligator Piel Frama case so notice no heat, nor heaviness... But I do feel that less battery life for a lighter unit would suit me. Bottom line, it does no more than the original except I do use the camera, enjoy the clear text, notice less lag and much quicker stutter-free play. I sold my old unit and would NEVER ever ever complain about the blazing 4g speed with which I can play and enjoy the internet on the move. A few hundred dollars difference for somthing I use hours a day is super cheap, like pennies an hour. Trouble free, pretty, effortless to use, and the cost of half a day at Vegas : ) ... Five stars for a product that simply works better than I need it to for EVERYTHiNG... let the haters hate... I am content, and to old men that is love...

Content: Lamen terms please!!! Okay, first of all I have read through about 10 customer reviews of this new iPad 3rd Gen. I must say that I am very impressed at some of these "editorial like reviews". Well after all of the technical stuff, I'd like to just keep it plain and simple.I never owned an iPad before last week. I was always saying that Apple was overrated and actually they're not. I have owned all kinds of "other" cellphones, smartphone and tablets. Well, last month I finally brokedown and purchased an iPhone 4S and now this cool looking iPad 3rd gen 32GB. I will just say that it makes my Samsung Galaxy Tab look pretty lame and boring. I had ordered mine online and could not wait for it to arrive earlier this week. Well anyway, I opened it up registered it on iTunes and began to sync it to my account. Well after that I began to mess around with everything and had so much fun doing so, that I didn't go to bed until really late. I was impressed that it was fully charged up when I turned it on for the first time. The graphics are second to nothing elso out. I purchased some Beats by Dre Studio headphones so I could listen to music and movies in quiet places. I love everything about the new iPad...I really don't even need a regular desktop anymore. I have considered buying an iMac desktop maybe later on down the road. I heard that some people complained about the iPad getting hotter than normal on one side, well mine has not so far, I assume Apple fixed the problem with that.Now, on the flip-side of the coin, I must say this new iPad is really heavy and dense like, I am turned off from that aspect, especially since a lot of reviews say the iPad 2 is much lighter, why is this one so heavy!? Secondly, I think this model should have an sD card reader and at least one USB 2.0 port. Lastly, I think they should have added Siri to this new iPad since she's such a hit with the iPhone 4S.Well hopefully this review is pretty simple to absorb and can be really helpful to someone. All and all, I really enjoy my "new iPad", but the last things I mentioned above is the reason why I gave it an 8/10 or equally 4/5 stars rating.**Forgot to mention**, iTunes is really cool and now they have the iCloud feature. So what ever you decide to download it will automatically appear in other Apple devices that you have registered. I currently own 2 other devices and it's nice not to have to download everything via the computer, with iCloud it's already there.**UPDATE**  9/22/12 A few days ago, I was able to update my iPad 3rd Generation to iOS 6 (so this means "Ms. Siri" is now available on this generation of iPads). I said thank you, they have answered our prayers. One strange thing that happens when you update your operating system is the YouTube App disappears...IDK what that's about.

Content: It is great! I bought it three days ago and it was a second hand "like new". It is working very well, came fast and we also received a case for it as a gift. It was a good deal! We also could go to the apple store and register it under the new name. This ipad was bought two months before and we still have 11 days for getting some support online if we need to. My son is having lots of fun and we could downloud some educational games. My husband and I didn't have our turns yet. But we checked and we can access our emails. Our family is very happy!

Content: Love It!!! I bought this for my 54 yr old husband who is "TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGED". He struggles with texting on his cell phone...for heavens sake! If there is any kind of problem with computers, phones or internet, I have to figure it out.I bought this tablet for him and he absolutely loves it! A chimpanzee can use it. There are no user manuals that he has to read...just turn it on. He carries it everywhere.I researched pricing and Amazon.com was the best deal by far PLUS it arrived in 3 days! Amazing! I would highly recommend the IPAD for anyone who gets overwhelmed with technology and even for grandparents (it has skype)! It is worth the money!

Content: DO NOT BUY THE VERIZON IPAD. I haven't had any problems with my iPad EXCEPT for deactivating my VERIZON account.  This product is advertised as allowing you to sign-up for service one month, drop the service when you don't need it, and then reactivate the service when you want it again.  DON'T BELIEVE IT!I used the Verizon service for one month, deactivated and received the message that my sim card is associated with another account or is no longer supported.  When I updated to the new IOS 6, the sim card was magically reactivated (!) and I could use the service again.  I signed up for a month's service again and at the end of that month's service, I deactivated and received the same non-service alert.All Apple forums on this problem have the same complaints.  Consumers need a new sim card and are hassled at the Verizon store to change service.  As far as I am concerned, this is false advertising so I have filed a complaint with the FCC as recommended in the Apple forum.  I am waiting for a call from Verizon before proceeding with replacing the sim card.  If I need to constantly replace a sim card then that should be stated in the advertising.The reason I purchased the new iPad was to be able to use it and pay for ONLY the months I WANTED and NEEDED, not for what Verizon wanted to sell me.  I am extremely disappointed with both Verizon for the service and Apple for allowing this to happen.  This is not how this product is promoted by both companies.If you want the new iPad, maybe you should try AT&T; instead of Verizon - maybe they have better service - maybe not!  Research it.

Content: Had to return one of three, not sure of others yet. Ordered three iPads, not getting any reduction in price, but needed them quickly and no Apple stores nearby. One was entirely broken, had to be returned. Returned it and replaced it with one from  the Apple store and got a lot of extra service by doing so. Would not purchase again from Amazon if an Apple store is nearby. Love the iPads. Combined with the Logitech Ultrathin keyboard it replaces a laptop for a low tech user. He reads library books, the newspaper, follows weather and the financial markets, emails and is a happy camper.

Content: Beware of fakes and scams. (Note: when I ordered this product, the title did not include the text "3rd generation".  the model number MD329LL/A is a fourth generation iPad (iPad with Retina display) as the technical specs make clear.)Important!  a 4th generation iPad has a narrow "Lightning" connector with 4 pins, not the 31 pin connector of older iPads.  This is the only obvious *external* difference between a 4th generation iPad and earlier models!  The other differences, like the "Retina Display", resolution of cameras, and speed of the CPU, are less obvious.  There are no markings on the outside of the box that would let you tell the difference between third and fourth generation iPads (e.g. no "third generation" or "Retina Display").If you have an iPad, the best way to tell which one you have is by looking at the model number displayed by the iPad software under Settings --> General.  Or look up the model number, written on the (physcial) back of your iPad, at [...] (Amazon won't let me include the URL, but a google search on "Identifying iPad models - Support - Apple" will turn it up as the first entry at Apple support.)Anyway, here's my story:I tried to order this product, a 4th generation iPad (with Retina display) from two different sellers, but received 3rd generation iPads both times.  I'm giving this one star because of the ordering problems, not the product (I hope that folks are more likely to read this if I put it down as a negative review rather than a positive one).The fist seller, "IMG Direct", sent me an obviously used 3rd generation iPad in the box of a 4th generation iPad.  The order was fulfilled by Amazon.  Amazingly, Amazon took the blame for this as a "packaging error" and voided my 2 star rating for the IMG Direct on the grounds that it was Amazon's fault(!).  I strongly suspect it was IMG Direct that supplied Amazon with the re-marked product.The second seller, "Wirelessnow", sent me a new 3rd generation iPad with the box relabelled to appear to be a 4th generation iPad.  At least it was a *new* 3rd generation iPad! (I'm planning to upload a picture of the remarked box.)I'm going to make my third attempt to order a 4th generation iPad, but this time the order will be direct with Apple!Looking through the reviews of a number of sellers, including "IMG Direct" and "Wirelessnow", i see a pattern where customers complain that they were shipped the wrong item and give a 1 star review.  Amazon then apologizes for the mistake and voids the review (the review remains readable but the 1 star score doesn't seem to count against the seller's rating!).This behavior is not limited to my two sellers -- its true of some other sellers as well!I'm going to speculate that Amazon actually pays the seller the ~$600 price for the mis-labelled item based on their "failure to fulfill it properly", so that this is a win-win situation for the seller.If the customer doesn't notice they've been shipped a cheaper product, the seller pockets the profits.  If the seller does notice and complains, Amazon takes the blame as a "fulfillment error" and gives the seller most or all of the original list price.If my speculation is correct and you're a seller, this is great!  Its a win-win situation.  Either the customer misses the substitution and you collect $100 or $200 more than the shipped product is worth, or the customer catches the substitution and Amazon takes the blame -- and you're still laughing all the way to the bank!  But I don't see why Amazon wouldn't wise up to the scam!Just my $0.02 -- YMMV (Your Milage May Vary).

Content: Please read this if you think of buying: Ok, I would like to start by saying that the iPad that my wife got for me has no functional deficits. The reason I am assigning a "1 star" rating to this product is NOT because we bought a defective unit. Nor am I disappointed with the service: every time I went to the Apple Store to get help (and that happened a lot!), a perky 16-year-old would materialize out of thin air and show me how to press the only button available to make the gizmo work.But herein is the rub: if buying an iPad, any iPad, please be aware of its limitations. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A SMALL COMPUTER, WHAT I GOT WAS A LARGE CELL PHONE WITHOUT THE PHONE!PROs:-- it looks cool;-- my kids love it;-- yes, there are a lot of free apps in the AppStore;-- you can check your eMail pretty much anywhere and any timeCONs:-- many "free" iPad apps are "teasers;" i.e. they have limited functions and you have to pay to get a full version of these apps only to discover that they are often faulty;-- NO Java support-- NO Flash media support (although the iPad does come with a free YouTube app)-- NO preloaded apps that would let you manage Word-type documents or Excell-type spread sheets (you have to buy those but, again, once you do, you soon realize that they are nowhere close to the quality of the ones you use on your desktop [Mac or Windows])-- most importantly, there is NO ABILITY TO MANAGE YOUR OWN FILES! This one particular lacking feature drives me to distraction! There are several apps you can BUY that would allow you to manage your OWN files but, again, they are very poorly designed and often do not interact well with iTunes, Windows, or, surprisingly, iPad's own OS system .-- and here is another critical issue: EVERYTHING MUST BE SYNC'd via iTunes. If you are running a Windows desktop, this may be (and in my case indeed IS) a serious problem. Things purchased via iTunes, iStore, AppStore, etc, usually manage to get to your iPad unscathed. Other content (e.g. I am an eBook fan and purchase my eBooks in multiple places on the Net) are not so fortunate. Although, Apple's iBook app is free and allows you to use both .pdf and .ePub formats (you can also install a free Kindle app for .mobi books),  actually getting your books onto your iPad may be difficult, if not impossible. You cannot "drag-and-drop" your book files (or any other files) onto your iPad. Everything MUST BE SYNC'd with iTunes, an app called "DropBox," or some other app. If your iTunes does not get along with your desktop (usually a PROBLEM FOR WINDOWS users like me),  you will end up spending endless grim nights uninstalling iTunes, re-installing iTunes, wiping your iPad clean, sync'ing and re-sync'ing your iPad again, and again, and again.-- The Camera is OK, but keep in mind that all your videos will be in .mov format and may not play on all desktops --you will need a special converter to re-code the formats for non-Apple media players; you will need to install "Quick Time for Windows" on your desktop if you are running Windows.-- finally, there is noway to increase the amount of memory for the device as there is NO slot for a memory expansion card. I can't believe it! Every tablet has it BUT iPad. So you are pretty much stuck with 16 gB, 32 gB, or 64 gB tablet without ever having any hope of expanding!OVERALL :  I feel so bad that my wife spent all that money, time, and effort to get me this. I feel awful that her loving good intentions made us spend ~ $900 for something that turned out to be just an appallingly expensive toy, poorly engineered, thoughtlessly designed, and very frustrating to use. (The MSRP is ~ $600 - 700, but there are sales tax, additional warranty, front cover, back cover, USB attachments, and other apparel that one needs for this thing, hence the enormous price!)  The good thing is: it is possible to easily re-set it back to factory settings. And we still have the original box. I think it will make a great (and a VERY EXPENSIVE) Christmas gift for my in-laws. For Windows users (like me): please, think hard before sinking all that money into this purchase! Again, keep in mind, this is NOT a small and portable computer, IT IS ESSENTIALLY A SmartPhone WITHOUT THE PHONE!... just a bit bigger, though...

Content: Excellent! Pros:Quick start up, easy to navigate and use. To put it in one word, convenience. We use it for multiple tasks, but mostly for browsing, communications, watching videos and some games. Basically laptop light. The major pro to me is the quick start up.Cons:Small screen, sometimes I find the words hard to read and the zoom function is not as good as on my laptop. Does not support some non-Apple programs. Not useful for word processing or heavier duty functions. It's basically laptop light (which is both a pro and con).I think of it as a super remote control that I can carry around the house, taking the place of the simpler functions of my laptop.

Content: Ok- but really a large print iPhone without calling capabilities. Buying this made me realize that all I really just wanted a larger cell phone.  I don't have 3G because I'm NOT paying any more for phone service.  It's heavy but I use it instead of my Kindle and many times if in an area with wifi can use it instead of my laptop.  But the question I keep asking myself - with no place to plug in a flash drive and no printing capabilities - WHY did I get it?

He has come a long way in a few days time and is signed up for a free Apple workshop to learn more. I am delighted that he has taken to it, especially since he will now leave my iMac to me!!  The thing really is seductive:  I have to keep reminding myself that it's his toy, not mine.

Content: faulty loud speakers. As soon as the ipad 3 was introduced I bought one to replace my ipad 2. After very little use for 52 days beyond warranty, during watching a video the sound stopped. I called support and went through a hard reset but still it did not work. I took it to the apple repair shop and I was told that this is a common problem with the ipad 2 and 3 and that the loud speaker has to be changed for the cost of $78.57 plus tax.I was vwery disappointed because I always believed that Apple did a good job with quality and did not expect this from them. If Apple had  a problem it had to recall or at least replace at no cost.

The condition of the iPad was exactly as described and even the little scratch in the bottom back corner of the iPad (which was noted) ended up disappearing somehow, which is great! Even though this iPad was used, it looks brand-new! This is definitely a trusted seller. =)

Content: Ipad3 64gb w/4g, the sound stops working after 1.5 years daily use. I bought the Ipad3 w/4g when it released. I paid $900(including tax). After 1.5 years daily use, the sound stopped working. I took it to the apple store for genius bar. After 40mins inspection, the tech told me it is the hardware issues, if I want to replace the speaker, I have to pay $299.  They can't fix it in the store. Really? It is almost the cost to pay for a new ipad. Then he told me I can trade it in on the apple website, that would be the best solution. I never heard about this, then I asked him to show me where to find it on the apple website. He couldn't find it, and then he went to the back to ask someone. 5mins later, he returned to tell me there is no trade-in on the apple website. OK, this is the quality of an apple store tech. Of course my ipad is broken after the warranty expired, because it is not made to last. Apple can't wait to release a new ipad every year so that they can get money from your wallet. I thought their product was good quality. Not anymore, it doesn't last.

Content: No more typing, easy to travel with, great tablet! Update 11/28/12. Update November 28,2012:After using the mini for a while, I have to say that I now hate my ipad....and only use it when the minis are being used by my wife and kids....in fact, nobody wants to used the ipads any more. I also do notice a difference in speed. I think what is slowing me down is my router and possibly having too many things connecting to it. Unfortunately, I Lso find that I have a hard time connecting sometimes and sometimes the screen freezes and does ot let me do anything. This does not happen at regular times or during specific times, but seems to occur randomly. I recently was unable to connect to the app store, though I had full internet access, etc. after about fifteen minutes I was able to connect. I do not know what happened or what changed. I still think the keyboard is too small for me, but I have large hands and nobody else in the family seems to be complaining. Maybe I would do better if I got to use it more. I did see someone with a kindle fire and with nly a short look at it, I think the mini blows it away.....thought I like that the kindle has the sd card slot......if I find anything else worth noting I will update my review. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Ok, so here's the thing, I have an iPad and a second generation iPad. My wife wanted the mini, so I bought it for her.....I just ordered a second one for me! I really like it more than the others. While it is significantly smaller, almost half the size, the actual screen size is comfortable and does not feel small. The borders are narrower than the full sized iPad, so the actual screen size is 4 13/16" x 6 3/8". The screen itself is very sharp and clear, and I feel like I'm 20 years younger (or at least my eyes feel that way). I wish I could say the same for the video quality. I take off a full star for that. Indoor quality with good lighting is mediocore at best (I wonder if something is wrong with mine?). Very grainy playback. I'm not impressed....I have not been able to play this on one of my HDTV's, perhaps it will show better, but I doubt it. My cell phone takes better video. I don't think I can be very happy about it, and I find it very hard to believe that this records at full HD, 1080p. If there is a way to tweak it, I wouldn't know because (here comes complaint number 2) it doesn't come with a user guide! No paper guide and no tutorial app (really, apple? There's so much new stuff, and no app, nothing???). I shouldn't have to search online or go to the apple store for information on how to maximize the use of my tablet.That should complete my complaints.....though you might hear a little more later. Now for the good stuff.... This thing is light! Two fingers light. The screen is also very bright and does a good job resisting finger prints. The LED Backlit display is crisp when viewing images and video that are actually made in good quality. The screen resolution looks much better than my second generation, but that's kind of an optical illusion I guess. They say the resolution is the same for both, so it must just look better because the screen is smaller. Here are some more stats:FaceTime camera: 1.2 mp photos and 720p video.iSight Camera: 5mp photo and 1080p video; f2.4 aperture; video stabilization; tap to focus and control exposure.Browsing is speedy, but honestly, I don't see much difference between my 2 and this. Viewing pages are fine and everything looks normal and sharp. Pages come up quickly and scroll fast. Zooming is also quick. I LOVE that you can multitask! Updating apps occurs in the background.Lots of great app, including photo and video editing and FaceTime, but for me, the reason to order a second one is Siri. Yup, that wonderful little digital assistant who will do anything for you...well, just about. I didn't know how much I needed Siri until I started to use it. I can now make appointments on the fly, make reminders, and organize my life in a way that was not previously known to me. This is THE best way for me to deal with so many different appointments, reminders, etc.. The sad part is that now I know I need an iPhone, as well! The children love the novelty of Siri, but I find it to be probably the most useful technology for me. It will be life-changing for me.....as long as I continue to use it. It will be so nice to finally be organized. Along with Siri is the ability to dictate message, etc. Just hold the microphone icon down for a second and start talking. I think that it is in need of some real sophistication, e.g. dragonspeak type quality. It will not place punctuation, and needs to be trained (I don't know how to do it yet, as I am still searching to see if that is even possible) to get better accuracy. An unofficial test estimates 70% or so accuracy, sometimes better if I speak slowly and there is no backround noise.The sound is also very good. Very clear. Not that loud, but then, you can't expect room filling sound....still, it is very acceptable. No complaints there. The only problem is with the lightning connector. I will have to buy an adaptor to connect the mini to all of my docks/speaker systems/etc. That's another thirty or forty dollars depending on which adaptor I decide to get.If you are looking for the user guide, go to the applestore and click on userguide, sorry, you're stuck, that's the only way. You would think they would include it in the iBooks app! I mean, really? How hard would that have been?I can't tell you if this is better or worse the the Kindle Fire because I have never seen one. If I find someone who has one I will do a full comparison. But for me, I think I need the technology that Siri offers (that's why I ordered the second one). If Kindle Fire has something similar, I am unaware of it, and will likely kick myself. :-) If you have any questions, I check for comments every couple of days. I hope you found this helpful.

Content: Light weight. Long battery life.  Great for people who travels. This is the smallest iPad currently available.  It is very light, thin, and typically I average 11 hours of usage per full charge.  Although it does not have the retina display, it has no effects on reading email or web surfing.  It is easy to hold and it works just like a regular iPad.  I would definitely take the iPad mini with me when I travel for business.  If a person prefers a larger screen but does not want to break the budget, I would recommend getting the iPad 2.  The prices are almost the same a few days ago during Black Friday.

Content: LOVE the MINI. Finally an iPad mini. WOW! Not too big, not too small. Much more functional and portable than the standard 11" screen iPads. Screen is clear and crisp. Movies look great. Very light weight. Beats every other 7" category pad hands down. I ordered both this iPad-Mini and the kindle fire HD, and realized the iPad was far superior. Plus you can load all your previous iTunes purchases, including movies, to the iPad mini. If you use iTunes and have purchases thru iTunes, the kindle WILL NOT allow sharing of any of all those iTunes media files. Only the iPad will. Battery last an amazing long time. Much longer than the old 11" iPad's. Probably because it is smaller and uses less energy? Uses the newer apple plug. Same connector as the iPhone 5. Charges with the same smaller apple usb-cube power wall charger. Comes with the same power cube as the iPhones come with. No special high powered cube, as does the larger 11" iPads require and came with. What a treat to use. I sold my iPad 3 for the same price as this mini costs, so I broke even. Plus, the old iPad 3 included ATT cell service. This iPad was the only wifi version. What to do? Get the ATT hotspot, nearly free and same monthly fee, and use this mini with the hotspot. Plus, hotspot allows multiple wifi devices to tap into the wifi hotspot, where as the built-in cell service on the iPad-3 only supplied cell service to that one device, your iPad -3.Save a lot by getting the iPad-mini wifi version, PLUS a hotspot. Best of all worlds. Much more functionality. Same fees.Don't let only one device hog your cell service, share it with a hotspot to all your iDevices (as well as all your non-apple wifi devices).PS. If you want your iPad mini NOW, this price is not that bad.And it was in stock.And shipping with prime was excellent.Just compare what other non-apple supply sources/stores are asking, like HSN or ShopNBC. Now THAT was highway robbery.Figure in NO TAX, availability, prime shipping, and there you are! IPad-mini in hand without the nightmare of entering the horrifying local Apple Store. EEEEK! TAX! Crowds! Zombies! EEEEK!

Content: So excited! My husband told me I could have one for Christmas- an iPad 4 or a mini. I chose the 4 in the beginning, because i was sure the mini would be too small. I have played with my husbands kindle fire, and it was just to small. I figured I could have no real use for anything smaller than the original iPad I already had. Then I started researching, and found out that the mini seemed to be a good choice. I went in and compared the two side by side, and was amazed at how much I loved the mini. So I changed my mind and asked for the white 32gb mini instead. I regret nothing! This thing is awesome! It's so thin and light, and just all around beautiful. Much more portable than the larger iPad, but I didn't lose out on the ability to see it, either. It's nowhere near the small, impossible to see mess that is the kindle fire. And the white one makes me think of both high tech future technology, and a white chocolate slab. Both are wonderful :-)

Content: Revolutionizes the iPad experience. I've owned the iPad 2 for more than a year now. I use it everyday mostly for reading. I've tried many games on it and found the game experience to be wanting.iPad mini changes everything.Before taking the Mini home, there were things I obviously liked, and some things I was a little worried about. For instance, although you can hold the Mini with no effort because of how light it is, I heard talk that comic books were harder to read because of the smaller size.i haven't found this to be true. After reading several comics, I am very pleased with the experience.And games - all those games I couldn't quite get into because of the size of the larger iPads have now been opened up to me. The lightness of the mini, combined with the positioning of your hands on it's smaller frame have changed the experience. The thin bezel at the sides has proven to be plenty wide enough for me. The same games I tried on the larger iPad 2 are now much more enjoyable on the iPad mini. A big enough screen to enjoy the action, but not so big as to introduce awkwardness.Oh, also the speakers on the Mini are great. You will not be straining to hear what's going on in the videos you watch and games you play, unlike the iPad 2 experience.Throw in Siri and a respectable camera, and the iPad mini is the defining iPad experience in my opinion. I don't even miss not having retina, as some theorized would be the case.Do yourself a favor and get at least the 32 gb size. You don't want to continuously have to delete stuff in order to make room. Also, iPads slow down when they start getting low on memory. 32 gb will give you plenty of room for lots of stuff to enjoy, while leaving enough room so your iPad doesn't get bogged down.

Content: Apple, please send a quick start manual. This was way more expensive than the store price, but stores were out well before Christmas.  Purchased with cover and screen protector - using cover only not screen protector.  Cover is a good idea, but just not designed very well - irritating and hard to access the buttons.Of course the mini itself is great, but my husband and I are not spring chickens and the fact that Apple can't spring for a one page "quick start guide" is frustrating.  You have to go online for any help at all.  Young techy people will have it up in 2 minutes, it tood us quite a while to set up the Wi-fi.  Once done, it's been great.TOO EXPENSIVE.  I had to pay $469.00 here for grouping of mini, cover and screen cover.  Keep looking for a better deal because there's one out there.

Content: Great but could be improved. Pure quality built product. Looks great and is  the coolest tablet out there. Super light. Display is excellent and apple maximized its screen to have very little border which is a plus.  Battery life seems decent. Processor speed seems to be quick. Able  listen to music and have other programs going.I have another tablet HTC evo 4g tablet and it is also a great tablet. So, I am comparing the mini iPad to that. The size is much better than the full sized iPad. However, it is just a little too big for my hand to hold comfortably for long periods. My HTC is much better sizing in that respect. Also, it is a little slippery but nothing a silicone sleeve can't handle. My biggest gripe is that it doesn't have text reflow and the text starts out tiny in the browser.  The android os leads in that category because no matter how large the text is magnified it reflows to fit the screen. Apple products need a true text reflow. Also, I like how you can customize android's screens in regard to icons and widgets. The mini iPad is is lacking in that area.All in all it is a great tablet and built to high quality standards.

Content: Perfection. As a first-time iPad owner, I am very pleased. I think it is safe to say that I am officially obsessed with the newest addition to my little Apple family:) Having small hands, this is the perfect sized tablet for me and its sleek design makes transportation a breeze. I also wasn't aware that Siri was on the iPad mini and was ecstatic to finally meet her;) The first thing I noticed when I saw it in person was that it is not as small as depicted online. I was worried about it being too "mini" but it is noticeably bigger than the iPhone 4 (about 4 times bigger) and significantly smaller than the normal iPads.One thing I was slightly disappointed with was the App Store. I found that several of my most-used apps on my iPhone were not available for the iPad. However, I am still glad I treated myself to a little post-Christmas gift and I'm excited to explore my new iPad mini!If it wasn't evident already, I would of course recommend this iPad to anyone, especially to those with smaller hands.

Content: Absolute junk for the price Apple charges. The quality of the screen on this tablet for this price is really poor.  Text looks really bad on it compared to other "mini" tablets that are a lot cheaper.  I am staying with my nexus 7.  When I used the ipad mini the text seemed a lot worse then my nexus 7 which is 40% cheaper.  The aspect ratio is 4:3 which is not good for video, low resolution, low pixel desnity, no gps.

Content: Amazing tablet but calm the price! Ok so I have a nexus 7 and as much as I love it and love the android operating system I can't lie and say the performance is always wonderful. It doesn't matter what the specs are it stutters with web browsing, a lot of games lag. It's really nice for the price but meh. Anyways I decided to overpay for the iPad mini because i'm an idiot and also because I saw better performance from youtube videos. Plus I wanted some of the exclusive apps. The tablet performs amazingly. Every app, game, and just everything runs great! The screen could be sharper for what I paid but I will take performance over a pretty screen any day. I kinda find ios a bit boring as well because I prefer the complication of android. I would love the emulators but i can't get them on the mini. There's no jailbreak for the mini so no emulators. The camera is ok but I have an actual camera that kills the ipads camera so that's nothing worth paying for. I love the screen size, and the weight. I love how thin the device is as well. All in all it's a great tablet but it does carry a price tag based on the massive ego of apple and not so much the product. 1 star is removed for the price. It's hard to remove more then that because I really like the product.

Content: Another Great Apple Product. This is my 4th iPad (2 1st generation and one second generation). The title of the review says most of it: I am as happy with the mini as the others; and it is a good step up from the 1st generation. The smaller size makes it easier for travel and things like flying. That said, you do need to think about the size of the tablet and how you are going to use the mini. Typing takes some additional getting used to: in portrait it is wider than an iPhone and hard to hold and use thumbs. In landscape it's smaller and harder to "touch-type".

As everyone i love the Apple products, i have an iphone, ipod, mac and to complete the collection the ipad mini, the devices is awesome, the weight is really light, size adequate. Perfect to carry wherever you go and work but you should buy in the store, my box brought a damaged cable, not such a big deal but i had to go to the store and ask for an exchange, the did it without showing the receipt, after that everything was fine.

Content: Awful!! I have had a REFURBISHED iPad for 2yrs that is 100% better than this expensive piece of junk. I purchased this because of its size and easy portability. Should have just stuck with my original and saved $400. It shuts itself down, freezes and just today sounded like it sparked and I had a totally blue screen for 10 minutes before either I finally got it to shut down or it crashed itself. Unfortunately for me, I was overly optimistic when I purchased it and threw the damn box away so I'm stuck.

Content: Love it. What a great toy . I still am trying to figure out how to work the many features. Love to Skype my grandkids and watch old movies on Netflix. Have not figured out how to download my video documentaries. The movie camera feature is a real blast. This might be the gadget made for us old folks. I bought the mini ipad hoping to find a replacement for my old Zune. It is on the road to extinction as I am and I wanted a device to store my library of video documentaries. I would watch these videos while waiting on my wife while visiting her many doctors. I bought a Kindle Fire but it did not have the capacity for storage. It looks like the Mini ipad will fill the bill. I would like to watch movies from Netflix and Amazon but the doctors' offices are not rigged up for waiting spouses' comfort as yet. As soon as I can figure out how to configure the format for my videos for the mini ipad I will be really happy with my purchase.

Content: Superior to Google Nexus 7. I held off buying the Mini because of all the reviews that rated my Google Nexus 7 tablet as far superior, but now that I have both, I believe it's the Mini that is better.  I think they are both great but here are the key deciding factors:For Mini:Screen size is better...you can see more without scrollingFor web browsing, it doesn't  default to mobile pages, always showing full sized pages which I preferGlass surface feels better to tap (strange but true)Charges much faster and charger fits more snugly into deviceHolds charge for a longer timeAgainst Mini:Screen resolution is crisper on Google Nexus 7Web pages load slightly faster on Google Nexus 7 in my side by side testSo while both are excellent, for me the Mini is better!

Content: Can't live without it now! I have an iPod Touch I can't live without. I use it everyday. It is not the newer one but I was thinking of getting the 5th generation Touch that has the retina display or the mini iPad even though it did not. I have an iPhone 4S so it does not have the retina either. I was really leaning towards to the Touch but decided to get the 32 iPad mini in white.I bought mine at a store that has BB as the initials and they also have an offer for a free Belkin cover/case that I love! When I unpacked it, it was mostly charged so it did not take long to charge the rest of it. I thought I would have a hard time converting over from the 30 pin connector but have not missed it.I own an Acer tablet that is too big to hold and heavy. My 4th generation iPod Touch is too small so I am glad I decided to go with the mini iPad. It is literally just right! It feels good in my hands, does not weight much, looks gorgeous, and is so easy to use!If you are on the fence like I was, I don't think you will regret it. I would get the 32 over the 16 though for it is only about $100 more and double the space. I have a 16 iPhone it filled it up in five months.I am happy I own it and regret not getting it sooner. If you are unsure, try it out in person and you will see what you are missing out on.

Content: I Love It! I'm an avid reader and a writer who has tried every portable device under the sun. Smart phones (even the large ones) are too small to read comfortably or to type; laptops simply are not portable enough due to short battery lives; and other tablets were uncomfortably large for me (I've got small hands.) I've tried taking notes directly on screens with a stylus; I've tried Bluetooth keyboards; and I've tried typing directly on screens. Everything was either too large or too small. Other, similarly-sized tablets tend to lag, or the battery life is very poor.I've been an Apple holdout for a while. I had a little iBook a long time ago, and the system issues, general uselessness of the battery, the severe problems with transferring Word, Corel, and other word processing documents, and all-around, irritating, proprietary nature of Mac turned me off for several years. Don't get me started on what I thought of the pricing.After doing a lot of research, however, I took a chance on an iPad mini. It was the perfect size (decent screen, super thin, super light) the battery life is supposedly long (it is--seven hours on the brightest screen setting, several days on standby, 10-12 hours with a low or medium bright screen) extremely portable (very, very important) easy to backup (and from the backup, export to different formats if needed) and does exactly what I need it to do (word processing, graphic art, reading, and surfing.) I have never been happier with an electronic device. (I also use it as an iPod. And as a player for my Google Drive. It's fabulous.)To repeat, it's absolutely perfect for me. I can work on it for hours, it's powerful enough for professional art programs, it's great for writing (the native note app, Google Drive, the Corel app, and a couple of others) and it is by far the best screen for reading I've come across.I tried a Bluetooth keyboard, thinking the screen would be too small to type on. The Bluetooth was a dud--it only worked once--but that was a happy accident. The iPad mini is exactly the right size for me to comfortably type onscreen.I have no complaints with Safari. It's super-fast and while it isn't my favorite search engine ever, it naturally does the job. The only issue I had was figuring out how to open a link in a new tab. (This took me a week. I can be a little slow.)Now that the rave is over, there are a couple of caveats.First, while the screen is the perfect size for me to type on, I'm a small female with hands about 2/3 average size, so it may be too small for some people to comfortably type on.Second, there are (as noted by other reviewers) no USB ports. If you need a lot of memory, this is not the device for you. There is no easy way to expand it. This was actually a little disappointing for me, but Google Drive and Dropbox solved the problem for me. (I'm a lucky person who is never far away from a WiFi signal.)Also, there is no way to replace the battery. When it starts dying, it's done.It doesn't have the retina display that comes with the larger iPads. (It's still a better resolution than many other devices, but hey--no retina display is no retina display.)Finally, there isn't really any way to get around the price. It costs more than some laptops, and certainly more than the other tablets of its size.Personally, I think it's worth it. The sheer portability and quality of the item is incredible. The fact that it is literally perfect for everything I need to do makes it even better--for me.I strongly recommend the iPad mini, with one caveat: do your research. Make absolutely sure you know exactly what you need and what you want, and invest in a product that meets that. This is not the item for someone who needs a lot of onboard memory or a ton of power. Someone who wants just to surf or just an e-reader may be better served with another product, too--but then again, maybe not (like I said, this functions as the most delightful e-reader ever.)I love it, and I think most people will. Have fun =)

I'm so excited my iPad came so quick I got it the next day although the case wasn't ready to be sent I so appreciate that my main order was still sent out super quick faster than I expected and packaged very well. My kids use it more than I do until I get used to it at least but I love all the free games that are available for my 6 and 11 year old as well as books. It keeps them super entertained in the car or keeps them off the tv :) I am lovin it and slowly becoming addicted to amazon.......thank you very much

Content: Best portable tablet. I am a gadget junkie.  I buy and sell my gadgets all the time.  This tablet will be one I hold onto for a long time.  The screen is a perfect size, the size is so light and portable, the camera is great  and while I absolutely loved my ipad2, this one is even better.

Content: LOVE my iPad Mini - right size for me, screen size great. What more can be said about Apple - I'm not an "Apple Snob" but have to say that their small devices - iPod, iPhone, iPad - cannot be beat.  Navigating, app library, organizing - much easier for me on an Apple product than an Android and I've used both.  That being said - there are others who are committed Android users and I'd recommend reading their reviews of those products before deciding. Bon chance!

Content: Come on,  its Apple! Very light and portable. I love it. The full iPad experience in a smaller version. The big iPad is too big for my taste. iPad Mini is perfect for watching movies, reading books, surfing the net, shopping, and listening to music. People complain about the screen resolution but I don't have any problems reading or looking at it. You can notice a difference if you have an iphone. But its not a huge difference. Its wonderful to have a small tablet. Apple has done exceptionally well with iPad Mini. Go for it, but it if you can.

Content: Great Product. I never thought I would buy 7 or 8 inch tablet. I'm the owner of iPad 4 and now I recently purchased iPad mini. When I compare two of these devices, iPad 4 definatey little faster but not by large margin. I thought by putting iPad 2 processor chip iPad mini would be lagging but I was wrong.. Apple did update the Internet wifi chip and it has the same network card found in iPad 4. iPad mini is fast when it comes to browsing and watching youtube videos etc. I don't see any big of a difference when I play iPad 4 and mini side by side.. Mini is so light and handy,now I barely use iPad 4. I'm very satisfied with iPad mini.

Content: Beyond expectations. I just cant put it down. I want to carry it everywhere with me. It is the first iPad in my home and its the most excitement we had as a family over a gadget. Everyone wants one now. I own an iPhone 5 and iPod. I was never interested in an iPad because of size. I considered it to be a big iPhone and debated for months whether I should get an iPad 4 or the mini. I am so happy I got the mini. I really can't see that much difference with the retina. If fact my iPhone 5 looks so small and clustered. It is the best gift I have had since the iPhone. This iPad made me play games again. I stopped playing games on iPhone because of screen size.Pros:The size is perfect.The screen looks greatIt's fastWell madeHas great accessories i recommend Invellop leather case. It's perfect.Battery last long.1000s of great apps.It's Desirable.So far there is nothing that I would call a con.

Content: iPad Mini was advertised as new but it was used and defective. I placed an order for the iPad Mini 64 GB WIFI.  I ordered it from TechGiant.  The order was shipped promptly.  However, to my surprise, when I went to register the device to qualify for Apple's free one year warranty, I was informed that the device had already been registered by another user in 2012 and that I only had 119 days remaining in the warranty.  That might explain why the battery was 20% low when I plugged it in and it prompted me to restore files from iCloud.  I plugged the device in and the charger didn't even work.  I paid $519 for a device that was advertised as new but it was not.  I didn't have a way to contact the shipper so I contacted Amazon.  They instructed me to return the item for a refund.  They also gave me a link to try to contact the seller.  I called a phone number on the seller's website and left a message explaining the situation.  I stated I wanted to give them the opportunity to correct the problem.  This was a few days ago and I still have not received a return call from the seller.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and still don't have an iPad Mini I need for a trip I have coming up.

Content: Charging cord included not an Apple cord! I love my iPad Mini, However it does not charge properly part of the time. The cord seemed defective, so we took it to the Apple store to get a replacement. We were shocked to find out from the Apple employee that the charging cord that came in the box with my brand new{?} Apple iPad Mini bought from this seller is NOT an Apple product! So buyer beware! How does that happen ? Makes me question if the Mini was really new. It is past time for returning it, so I have no recourse but to write this honest review to tell others to beware of buying from this seller and if you do, check the cord included right away to see if it is in fact an authentic Apple product. I have never written a review, much less a negative one, but felt others should know about this discrepancy. My husband bought it from one of the higher rated sellers so this sort of thing wouldn't happen. Oh well!

Content: Brilliant! My first Apple product. I will be using it principally for use in the field for observation of birds. It allows me to carry electronic guide books with a great weight saving, make lists and notes of observations and play songs and calls. It will take a little time to adjust to the Apple interface after PCs, but so far it seems very practical and intuitive. I will also use it for book-reading and I am very pleased to find it so comfortable for reading.I would have liked to know that a couple of apps only work properly after synching to iTunes, but I figured it out eventually!

Content: Apple seems to really milk us for all the money they can. There is a lot of things not working on my ipad mini and when I call apple for help, apple wanted more money before they would give me any advice on how to work my iPad mini. My iMessage & ICloud wouldn't work and still isn't working, I'm refusing to pay more money for something I've already paid more than enough already. On top of that it seems an ipad is very limited to what an ipad can actually be used for. You will still need a regular laptop or home computer for most things, for iPad doesn't allow, which is A Lot!. iPad mini is basically a big mobile unit. It's not looked at as a laptop. It would be better to buy a lap top than a iPad!!!!! iPad is a empty money pit that doesn't end, it's like buying a used car.

Content: Just overjoyed with it! I am in position of an iPad 3th gen and now I got the iPad mini. It took me a while to decide on it whether or not I would even need it but having it for 3 weeks now I did need it. First of all for the money you get a high quality Apple product, which is fully capable to meet with the demands that are expected from it. The nice thing about the size is that it is exactly right for holding it in one hand without being to heavy or the display being to small. I hardly use my old iPad, which already says it all. If you are thinking about buying an iPad and you need a light tablet that is just as good as the big once I would advice buying this one. The batterylife is really good and the display also preforms good in he outside daylight. All and all it's a full Apple worth mini iPad. The only advice I can give for now is wait on the 15th of October because speculations say that on this keynote an new iPad mini will be presented with retina display.

Content: Great little machine, no need for retina in my opinion. When the mini came out it was just what I wanted, an iPad thin and light enough to use comfortably wherever I needed. The 4G option is great if only for the built-in GPS which is missing in the Wifi version. This device is perfect for reading and carrying around with you wherever you go. It's also been supremely useful as a mobile tether when I've needed to work while out. It's also great to have the big screen for GPS/Waze when you are travelling rather than a mobile phone screen, you get to see a lot more context on the map. I have a retina iPhone and I really don't notice the lack of retina on my mini.Only thing I'd say is 16 gig is small if you want to take lots of photos or load up a few HD movies on it in addition to your music, games, apps etc.I think I'll change up to the retina mini 64 gig w/4G whenever I decide to upgrade, but I'm in no hurry, my mini is great :)

Content: iPad mini. Love it- only complaint is I should have purchased one with more storage than the 16.  But that's my fault.  Love the size, features, ...everything .  Would highly recommend purchasing.  Then would also suggest really studying up on its capabilities, because there's a lot more to this little tablet than meets the eye.  Great product- worth the extra money to purchase an apple!

I was skeptical at first reading all the reviews but I took a chance and ordered it off here. Saved me money and the delivery was beyond fast. I only waited 4 days with free standard shipping.

Content: not satisfied... I opened it, and as soon as I picked it up, I could tell it wasn't a great buy. The resolution was annoying, and not very fast response to touch. The plastic feel made it seem cheap, and the screen, without a protector, scratched VERY easily. Ive got a samsung galaxy tablet2, and a lePan TC tablet as well.  Their screens are so much better, and the builds are solid feeling. The lepan was only $124.99 off of amazon. I would recommend getting a different brand. LePan 9.7 inch is a good choice, or if you're looking for a pricier tablet, go for tha samsung galaxy!here is a link-Le Pan TC 970 9.7-Inch Multi-Touch LCD Google Android Tablet PC

Content: Lots of problems. I bought this tablet back in April after reading lots of reviews and doing lots of research. Unfortunately the problems started almost immediately and I talked myself out of sending it back and now it is too late. For internet browsing, it is almost a complete waste of time. From the very beginning the built in web browser would freeze and I'd sit there for a few minutes watching an unmoving screen until a "Browser has stopped working. Wait or Force Close" error would appear. This error presented itself constantly with almost every app I opened, and every incident of trying to browse the internet. I downloaded the dolphin browser to see if that would fare any better. It did not. I also thought that not having access to Google Play wouldn't be that big a deal, or would be something I could get around via the Amazon mobile marketplace. This is not the case. Because you cannot download from Play you cannot get Facebook and a number of other very popular apps. Getjar's selection is paltry at best, and even trying to download directly from website does not work (most of them reroute you to Google Play anyway).I also had issues with the preinstalled book reader, aldiko. As with all functions it would constantly freeze and I would get the wait or force close error. Often I had to try to open the same app multiple times and I would get the error multiple times until I would run out of free time or just be so frustrated I had to give up.I was hoping that an update to the software might help the problem, since that was the experience I had with my phone; it had suddenly starting having lots of problems which persisted for a few months, until an update came out and from then on it ran very smoothly without any of the old errors.However, THERE IS AND WILL NEVER BE an update for this tablet. It is in the tablets FAQ on the Coby website. This is despite the fact that there is an "automatic update" options in the settings but this is for the apps and not the tablets internal software. Though in the tablet explorer program, I do receive a notice stating an update is available but every single time I have ever tried to update it, I sit and wait for 5 minutes while it downloads, choose the option to install and then get an error every time saying there is conflicting programs so the update could not be installed.And again, Coby's own FAQ states there will not be any updates made for the Coby Kyros 4.0.So I used this tablet mostly as a book reader using the FBreader app and for a while that worked out quite well. Sometimes I could get through to browse the internet, at least enough to check basic things and maybe read an article or two, but I do also have a laptop so for more advanced pursuits I used that.But then about a few weeks ago, a strip of screen about an inch wide, running along the left side of the tablet stopped responding to my touches. This is giving me issues with turning the page while reading, and if I want to type in a search or write an email I am constantly having to turn the tablet in circles in order to get the keyboard keys out of the unresponsive section and this is quite an exercise in patience. Sometimes it is not even possible, because in certain apps and websites the keyboard disappears as soon as the screen is turned to a different angle, and if the space you need to type in cannot be selected without turning the tablet to get to the needed keys, then there simply is no option to type in that field.I am not sure if all the Coby Kyros's have these issues but as I was hoping for an update which never came, I waited too long and now I cannot return the tablet. I could go through Coby's warrantee system but according to its website I have to print some documents and mail a cashiers check with the tablet, where it will then take several months to receive my new one. I am not sure I want to do all that just to be without a tablet at all for months. So I am considering just throwing or giving this one away and buying a new one. NOT a Coby.

Content: Coby Kyros 7-Inch 4.0 ICS. This is actually a good tablet. Fit and finish were excellent. The android 4.0 ICS is really cool, easy to operate, and is very fast. I was able to install all the apps I needed from the Amazon app store. I even got Skype to work on it. Overall this is a great tablet to surf the web, listen to music, play games, and e-mail with. I actually had to send it back though due to a popping sound when I used ear phones. I tried 3 different pairs of ear phones and got the same result, so I sent it back. Overall a great product at a great price.

Content: If you have an issue, you're on your own. Coby Electronics "customer Support" seems to think that all of their units have NO DRIVER SOFTWARE. Actually, ALL of them do. There is some sort of driver software that is required for any piece of hardware to communicate with a PC's software. Apparently, theirs operates on black magic. I have a MID7042 that doesn't connect to four different computers. Each computer attempts to download the "driver software" that Coby Electronics believes to be a myth, but then says that it was unable to. The computers' device managers get a CODE 10. This basically means, driver software missing, or corrupted. Coby Electronics customer support rep., "None of our devices use driver software." Really? None of them? Well definitely not this one. That's why it doesn't work. Thanks for nothing Coby, and Amazon for letting products like this slide. Can't even transfer a single document to or from this piece of junk.

Content: A couple of Aha Moments . . . Arrived quickly, and I was very happy with how it looked!Things to note:- This takes a very small, 5V DC power supply, which is unusual to me.- It is an unsupported Google device = no Play app store, and still can't figure out how to get HBO GO to work on it, and can't get Facebook created app (unless someone tells me where else you can download it from!)- Has a very sensitive power button - last 3 times I've put it in my backpack for use at work, the power button has been hit in transit and I arrive with it drained and unusable.  Could probably be remedied by buying a better case than by using the slipcover it comes with.- Back button often exits you out of something, rather than taking you to your last page/position.- Browser, while effective, does not have near the same functionality as the browser on my PC.- Browser feels slow to me, and it's annoying.Other things to note:- Sound quality was surprisingly good for what it is.- Keyboard is awesome and works really well, which surprised me.- Absolutely zero lag in streaming of either music or video - win!!!- You can still do lots of great stuff, like use other social media apps that allow you to view Facebook, or use the browser for it (can't get browser version of HBO GO however, *sad clown face*).- Use Amazon app store for lots of good stuff even if you can't use Google Play app store - the Get Jar app store was surprisingly limited.  Might just be the brand new O/S.- Picks up home wi-fi & mobile hotspot (wi-fi from my phone) just great, never had a problem with that!- Renders books really well and is fun to use for reading.Overall, because it is less than half price of any other 10" tablet out there, I will give it a "like" rating and deal with what it doesn't do.  But the HBO GO thing was a major blow and the big reason behind losing a whole star.  I've heard that they are supposed to be coming out with a new version of the app that I can get to and will work on this O/S, but my fingers are still crossed on that . . .Also, in case anyone from Google is reading this - you majorly effed up by allowing others to license your O/S by NOT also allowing anyone with said O/S's devices to be able to access YOUR CONTENT.  Lose move IMHO.  Retarded.

Content: Wtf. My son just got this yesterday and already this so much going wrong. At just 35% battery it flashes off and on continusly I haven't fully charged it yet but that can't be normal. Google play won't download and google plus keeps crashing as soon as it opens. The app center that comes on there barely have anything, Netflix took two times to download it on here. I hate that there is only a front camera so I guess he can only take pics of himself. I am so irked, I hope this is just a defected one which is still bad but this can't be as good as it get.

Content: great for certain things. This is for the 10" coby. I got it to replace the functions of an e-ink kindle. I wanted to be able to read books, surf some simple web pages, maybe check my e-mail and calendar, play some simple games. I liked the idea of a bigger screen that I could see page-size pdf (and maybe a comic book) on. It turns out that this tablet is fine for those needs.It actually seems made pretty well. The touch screen seems to work well - by way of comparison, I've had a couple of older tablet pc's, and older windows ce pda's, my wife has an older resistive touch 7" android, I have an android phone. So on the one hand I've used a lot of touch screens, on the other, I can remember when you had to have a proprietary batter-powered stylus to use one. So to me, the touch screen seems pretty good, but I don't know how that will translate to others. It is a finger print magnet and picks up smudges like mad. It is perfectly adequate for e-book reading and playing simple android games.I am an average sized male and the size is fine for me for a big book reader. The trade off of the bigger screen is that you have a bigger device to hold. I can just "palm" it with one hand - it is 16 X 9 so it seems longer than it does wide. I don't think it is too large to be a comfortable reader.The wi-fi connected in a snap, couldn't be easier. One thing that is sort of annoying is that everytime I resume from a suspend I have to disconnect and reconnect the wi-fi for it to connect. I haven't figured a way around that yet, but I think it may be an ice cream sandwich "feature." It connects easily to our linux computers with the cable.I found that I was more bugged by the lack of google play marketplace than I thought I'd be. As best I can tell, everyone who has tried rooting the 10" has bricked it. So I didn't root it. You can get the apk for google play easy enough and side load it, but the device isn't on google's list of approved devices so the apk won't run and connect to the market. Because you can't root it, you can't edit the boot file to spoof it as a device on google's list. So unless you root it or google adds it you won't be connecting to google play.Which isn't really that big of a deal. It has a get jar market on it, but I had already put on amazon market before I bothered looking at it, and there's really not much use in it. The amazon market is easy enough for anyone to add - just point the web browser to amazon and follow the directions. Of all things, the only thing I wanted to put on it so far but wasn't able to yet is tux math for the kids - it is on google play but not amazon market and I can't find the apk on the web. It was easy enough to side load other apks. It runs the angry birds apps fine, and the cut the ropes, fruit ninjas, temple runs. I had a devil of a time getting where's my water/Perry to install. It just wouldn't install. I tried different versions and nothing, then one time I tried it for a lark and both just installed and now they play fine. I must have installed something with a needed library or something along the way. Who knows. I downloaded free solitaire and freecell from amazon and they work fine. That's enough games for me, so I haven't bothered putting any emulators on it, without hardware buttons I don't care to.It has both a regular size usb and a micro usb, which is nice because you can use something like a usb key board. The power plug is an additional little port. The batteries last longer than I thought they would - good enough for me to read and play some games. I put some videos on there just to see them and they worked fine. The kids watched some youtube on it and that was fine. I couldn't get netflix to install on it though.It has an micro sd card slot, that is important to me. The file structure is a little wonkey, but you'll find the sd card if you look around. After the first time it didn't really matter to me because it remembered the location in the history and I can just click the short cut there.It comes with a book reader built in. I side loaded an epub file and it seemed to present it just fine. I went ahead and put the cool reader app on it because I like the flexibility of that app. I used it to read A Dance with Dragons an it was a good book reading experience - I turned off the background and just use white text on black or yellow on blue. Honestly I didn't miss e-ink and I was a fan of it.It isn't an ipad and it isn't a tegra 3. It is $150 bucks. So if you want the ipad or a tegra 3 don't get this. If you have some basic android experience then this will seem familiar and easy, and if you want a basic tablet then this is a fine one. I got lucky here, it fits my needs very well - so if you are looking for something like that, book reader, web, simple games, with a bigger screen I'd recommend this to you.

Content: The negative reviewers were right. Sadly, I am returning this item after a week of frustration with it. My main motivation for getting a tablet this size was so that I could connect to a keyboard and be able to write, anywhere, any time, and have the option of listening to music at the same time.It's just not possible. I'm confident the item was in good condition and Amazon is not at fault, but it just won't do two things at once. My attempt to listen to a playlist and use a word processing app resulted in distortion of the music. Overall, it is the slowest, clunkiest computer of any kind that I have used in ages. If you touch the screen before your browser has fully loaded a page, it kindly informs you that the browser is not responding and asks if you would like to close it. It integrates poorly with Google apps. Its wifi connection is unreliable. The screen is often unresponsive, and the orientation shift is clumsy. I hate to think how a game like Angry Birds would play on it. I do not recommend this product.I gave my Kindle Fire to my husband because his KF was having problems recharging. I have missed it for a whole week. If the other Kindle continues to have trouble, I will buy a new Kindle Fire HD in preference to a larger tablet.

Content: Coby Kyros MID 1042 Tablet. Ordered the Coby MID1042 Tablet from Amazon w/ free shipping. Cost $146.00.  I have to admit that after the reviews that I like the price but was leary about installing the apps.  This item arrived way before it was expected to. Packaging was good.  Plugged it in, charged it and it was ready to go.I was able to get ALL the apps I wanted onto this tablet.  Not all from the same sight though.  Getjar is ok and has plenty of free apps. Not the ones I needed tho.  But if you log onto the browser you can bookmark your favorite pages right on your home screen.  Amazon, Netflix, Yahoo mail, Pinterest, facebook booked marked really easy and open up to the last page you had.  Again these are right on your main home screen.Then I downloaded an app from Getjar called "Good E-reader android app store".  this app is actually a store, so I was able to download a few apps off of this app for free.  This also had Netflix Aodbe and lots of popular games.Then my struggle was trying to kindle onto my tablet.  It took me a while and a lot of research but I was able to download the "Amazon AppStore". right from amazon.com  Not easy, not hard.Here were the steps I had to follow.On my tablet I went to settings - then to applications - make sure the "unknrown sources" is checked.Then I went to Amazon Appstore and in the upper right corner it asks for you email.Then it sends you a email with a link to download.Once its downloaded, you can see on the home page the downloaded icon, the one with the down arrow.I clicked on that and it installed the app.  Pretty easy actually.After that I was able to download Kindle and Audible.I am very happy with this tablet, yes it did take me hours to figure out how to get some of the apps but I didnt have to download anything to my computer or put anything on an SD card.The screen doen not act like an Ipad.  It is not a tap screen, but more of a touch and hold for 1 second screen.  One you realize this it just becomes natural to hold the icon. Not bad, just different.I would recommend this to my family and friends.  All I can say is be patient when trying to set up your favorite apps.  They are there and I am glad I spent the time finding them.Just remember, If you want an Ipad, buy and Ipad.  This Tablet is great for the price and does everything I needed it to do.

Content: it's just what i needed. I was looking for a tablet to keep my gaming pdfs on and get to the internet on. This tablet does just that. I was skeptical about the lack of google play, but the amazon app store worked just fine for what I needed.Don't use the built in e-reader, the screen starts winking and blinking something awful, just get the adobe pdf reader. You'll be golden.The dictionary doesn't really seem to work, almost everything gets redlined, but it doesn't make the tablet any less effective for me,

Content: Very bad applications! The only problem with this product is that it does not have the Google Play store, to download applications, and can not be installed due to their software. The tablet comes with a application called "Getjar" which replaces it, and is very poor with respect the applications to download.

Content: Decent tablet at a great price. I almost gave this tablet a 4, but I'll get to the points that left it short.  I was considering an Ipad, but I just can't justify 500 bucks for something my wife will surf the web with.  Sure the Ipad has great points, but I think all their products are a bit over-priced.  So my main need for a tablet is Kindle/Ebooks, surfing, Facebook, and Youtube.  Got this tablet; right out of the box it looks pretty good.  The resolution is average, not terrible.  The device booted right up and not being familiar with Android I was able to make my way around.  It did take me a while to figure out how to load Kindle.  First you have to load Amazon app store; then Kindle.  I found a defect after the first time using Amazon app store; it does not return any app searches and just appears as a black screen.  Tried re-installing a few times; same problem.  Not overly concerned because I can buy my books using my laptop or Iphone and store on Amazon cloud.The good: Kindle performs well.  The web browser is good.  Youtube app is good too.  The response time loading pages is actually really fast.  Took a great deal of research(will cover in bad)but I found a Facebook app that works well.  So the basic points that I bought this tablet for are accomplished.  Capacitive touch is really cool too.The bad:Heard a LOT of other folks mention; you CANNOT use Google play.  Not being an Android person I did not know this is the Droid equivalent to Apple Store.  Major letdown, I looked and this tablet is not on the supported device list.  WHAT does this mean?  Did Coby not pay a license fee to participate in Google play??  The device runs the most current Droid O/S.  Really poor.  Sent email to tech support - still waiting for response.  I'm hoping they come up with a solution.  Battery life has only been 3 hours; acceptable but not great.  They leave you with an app store called Get Jar which is an open source app store that has the same feel as using something like Ubuntu Linux.  If you want an app and can't find it; you're best bet is to find what is called an apk file for the app you want.  That is how I finally got Facebook installed.  I could not find it on Get Jar.  I cannot say enough bad things about Get Jar so I will stop; oh one good point I did find Angry Birds on Get Jar.  The camera as mentioned is pretty useless.  Device does seems to heat up; but nothing extreme.So all in all I'm happy so far.  The hardware is pretty darn good for 90 bucks.  The major drawback is the app support, as I mentioned.  I would have given this 4 stars had it come with Google play support.  Please Coby, fix this problem and make this compatible with Google play!!

Disconnect from your PC.Then in your tablet go to:Settings > About tablet > System updates > Install system update > From internal storage > Install nowThen your tablet will shutting down and installs automatically the update.The final step when it finish is select  (with the power button of the tablet) the option "Reboot system now" and that is all, your tablet is rooted and the google play is installed in your apps when the tablet restart.Enjoy it!This process applies too to Coby Kyros MID7034, MID7036, MID8048, models.

Content: love it. good product and the price is what made me buy it . I needed something not to heavy to pack around at school. I bought the keyboard case with it and this is a perfect set up. It does take some knowledge on how to get around to downloading apps you want ,the get jar app didnt have everything I needed. You do need to install a few different app programs to get arround this issue. If you just stuck with what is on the tablet its pretty boring but learn how to minipulate it and its almost like a mini netbook. I do recomend the key board case to make it more useful, without it i dont think i would like it as much. the tablet its self is fast, volume could be better, and the picture is nice.

Content: SECOND TIME BUYING! This is my second time buying. This tablet is really great for web browsing and a little video browsing and a few pictures here and there. 10 inch version was amazing, this 7 inch one had a little issue. I'll list the cons and pros below.CONS--Screen lighting, screen is way to dark even when put on the full setting- Camera is flipped upside down. There is no way fixing that, that is how it was manufactured, I'm not sure if it was just mine or everybody's but it is upside down.- NO ANDROID STORE, ONLY GETJAR APP PLACE.-PlasticPROS-- Light weight-Cheap- Easy to carry- Easy to cleanFor the price this product is just find. But if you have the money, don't waste it buying this, save up a few more hundred and get a much better one.

Content: Product exploded and caught on fire in my 3 year olds hands. At first I thought this tablet was excellent for the price. It was exactly what we were looking for until ome day while my 3 year son was playing with it, it started to make a hissing noise, smoking, battery exploded and caught on fire. Luckily I was next to him to knock it out of his hands right away unfortunately onto my just over a year new couch. God forbid I wasn't there. He was not hurt, just scared and in shock. He still is upset when he remembers that his tablet is gone and what happened. His twin sister has the same one and that was placed in a metal box and stored in the garage.I did contact the company and we are still in the middle of this ordeal. I do not reccommend buying until they fix this issue.

Although, I am fed up with Windows OS; I think Apple (Ipad)is 10X overpriced and just longed for something to play with....and download Kindle books.  I love it for that alone.  I find it impossible to download the google apps from google play store...Everything about google is stupid, except the search engine in my opinion.  Once again, for a reading appliance and email machine this tablet is great.

Content: Freedom is needed, urgently! This is my first table. I'm used to Android OS, but never realized that Android OS can be more castrating than Windows!In a Windows OS you can go into C drive and delete whatever you want (even to destroy the OS itself). This Android is totally locked: you CANNOT install Market to have access to Google Play apps!?! (No Gmail, no Chat, etc) You ONLY can get apps from a "GetJar" app that is very poor and with few apps to choose from. You CAN'T even delete the pre-installed junk apps that come with it. These pre-installed apps are always running in the background consuming RAM and making this very slow tablet to be even more slow.Finally I was able to crack it down and now I have Market on it and managed to install some apps to kill the junky apps from running, but I'm not able to uninstall them. Freedom is needed to do whatever you want to do with your OS.The camera doesn't work already and the back cover is cracking although it never fall.

Content: Good unit for the cost! I previously had a 7" with only 2.3 OS until it was broken recently.  Found this larger tablet which is an improvement for screen size, not to mention having the latest 4.0 OS!  Haven't really found anything negative about it other than difficulty getting a cover/stand for it.  Finally located the only cover made to fit which is sold exclusively on Amazon for just $14!  It is an excellent case and highly necessary to protect this tablet.  I don't understand why the only large tablets are Ipads, Samsungs, Acers, etc. at $400 plus, then the Coby for $150 or less, and they are all using the same OS and many similar parts.  Sure, the Ipad and Samsung probably operate considerably faster in some applications, but really, to play some games, take some pics, and surf the net I will gladly sacrifice a couple seconds per function by saving $300 + dollars!!!  Considering how easily these tablets can be broken I can't afford the risk.

Content: DON'T DO IT. I got this tablet on sale through Verizon, I had it for a week, tried to plug it in via USB to my computer, it turned off and would not turn back on.  Verizon ordered a new one for me because it was under 14 days (Thanks for the good customer service Verizon).  I got the new one and immediately locked myself out (don't change your pass code late at night before you go to sleep).  I spent a week trying different combinations, found it, went to plug it in so it would not die as I was changing the pass code back to something I could remember, and it went dark again. Verizon couldn't take it back again, now I get to mail it to Coby at my expense with $15 and I suspect I will not be getting a refund.  I don't really want a replacement at this time, there must be a design weakness near the power/usb outlet. I can't get one to work for more than 3 days.  I will update when I find out for sure.  If you absolutely must try this out, get it from amazon, then it can be returned easily.

Content: Terrible. I bought this tablet twice, what a mistake. The first time it worked for 2 weeks and then I was not able to connect to the internet even though I had excellent signal strength on my home wi-fi. So I returned it for an exchange. The second one I got did not work from the get go. Constant busy signals to tech support did not help. When I finally got through they were no help. "Gee it sounds like it is defective"! Duh! Anyway I sent that one back too. I learned my lesson, you definitely get what you pay for. Cheaper is not better.

Content: Pros & Cons. To begin i'll start with the pros which there aren't many.ProsGreat if you just need something at the momentif your not tech savvy (Like me)Only wish to read books & very little web browsingConsIt does not download certain PDF, TXT, HTML, etcIt does not have google play (Which is my biggest turn off) because i did not realize it did not have good play until i powered it on and checked it out completely.it does not read certain things on your SD card.the camera is not the best :'( (Which is a inbetween since i didn't take a lot of pictures as it is)Recently my tablet did a infinite loop of power so it never came off the android screen so i had to reset it and loss EVERYTHING.Did i mention they did not offer Google Play Store? its baffling because its android material >.> if they wish to make TONS of people happy they need to fix that ASAP. Now if your looking at the reviews of this item safe yourself the trouble and the money and DO NOT buy it. its a very broken commodity when it comes to standards that people my age (20), Teen or and adult may need xD i see why they get IPADS

Content: disappointed. I bought this for my son back in February 2013 as his first tablet.  After a while, we started to get long delays on start up, and apps would either take a long time to open, or sometimes we would need to start all over again.  "The app is not responding...would you like more time" was a common message.  It then stopped working in November 2013.  We will try to get it replaced on warranty, if there even is a 1 year warranty for it.  If not, then I am really disappointed with my son's experience on his first tablet, which I do feel we paid a reasonable amount for.

Content: You get what you pay for. I bought my Coby Kyros tables 5 weeks ago.First thing I noticed was that the screen would go haywire.The lower right hand of the screen was sensing touch, and the setup would popup.It takes about 10 minutes for the unit to warm up, then everything is fine.After about an hour use, the unit will not respond to touch.ie the touch screen is crappy.The unit works fine around 25 to 38 deg C, or around 75 to 80 F.It takes forever to get the unit to stop responding to low temperature sensitivelower right of the screen.I rotate the unit 90 degrees, and confirmed that the unit is defective in the lower right.Because the touch area follows the bottom right corner.I bought a case to help speed up the warmup time.Power on, keep it in the case for 5 minutes, and it is about ready to use.Like most people reported, no support for Adobe Flash.  Sad sad.Google Play is not supported, so you have limited apps available on Getjar.I mainly use this for reading books, which works fine.Surfing internet is annoying, because it defaults to "mobile" site.The unit is capable of handling full websites, minus the flash.Camera is junk.I use the voice only option of Skype, while traveling.Would I buy this again?  Maybe...

Content: Good buy for the price. Overall I like the tablet, I've had it for over a week now and no major issues with it yet. The inability to have GooglePlay does somewhat make me regret my choice as I was hoping for an ability to do documents on the go (and some of my favorite apps for such are on GooglePlay), but still, Google has though of this already and on GetJar it does allow for the App "Google Docs" which allows you with a single click to access the Google drive.There has also been an issue that when I plug it into the computer with the included USB to USB2.0, it keeps forgetting that its plugged in on the computer's end. It stopped transfers to it saying that it couldn't be found and then by the time I was halfway through reading the message my computer would giver me the pop up of New Hardware found. An SD card solved this problem handily. the eReader is a little twitchy, but once you get to know it's quirks, it works well. Overall, it is a good machine for my intentions and I would buy it again.

Content: Spend a little more. Ok this pad is okay. I wish I spent a little more money for a better one. It does hook up to wireless routers just fine but it is definitely SLOW!! You have to have the patients of like dial up. Netgear that comes with it is almost useless. Netgear is supposed to be like android or the apple market. It is far from, very limited. I put amazon App Store on it but not as happy as I am with my App Store for my cell phone. If you get too many programs meaning 2 open windows you run a risk of it freezing up on you. I do wish there was a way to debug it but there isn't. I wanted something cheap that I could read my school assignments on and it did good but everything is slow if you want to play games or go online. I ended up giving it to my kids, they don't always mind if its slow. Mostly gets used for utube now. I'd say spend a little more money but if you want it to just read on, I'd still spend a little more.

Content: Avoid this one. The tablet died after owning it for a year. It no longer took a charge. I wouldn't recommend it. With tablet prices declining, there are much better ones out there.

Content: Unacceptable Customer Service. I really don't have the time to spend hours tracking down retailers who should stand by their products irrespective of price. The only reason I am doing this is that my 10 year old spent her own birthday money on this and I hate to see her disappointed and taken advantage of. On arrival, the tablet would work only when plugged in. It would not take nor hold a charge. DOAs happen with any electronics, but I expect the manufacturer or distributor to repair/replace the defective unit. We spent two weeks trying to contact Visual Land via phone calls, emails, and their website forms. All went unanswered. Tiger Direct, the shipper, has likewise not responded. I guess they know this thing is a lemon. Now I am trying to escalate with Amazon. This whole experience has been Completely Unacceptable and I would not trust this mfr or distributor again.

Content: It's not working, don't buy it. I bought this tablet and when I got it I couldn't open any website or even browser even though it was connected on wireless. I sent it back for repair or replacement but when I received it back (after a month, without any information about it in a mean time, my emails were ignored) it didn't work at all. Now I can't even turn it on. I'm really disappointed in this product. Don't buy it, you'll just waste your money.

Content: Droid Tablet 8.2" So far, My wife loves the Tablet, The only thing I have to complain about is that it does not come with a SIMS Card, you have to get that through your carrier apparently, and nowhere in the description of the product does it mention that! My suggestion is to put that piece of information where it can be seen easily!!!  She had to wait over a week before she could use her droid, because they had to send her one. This is like buying a brand new car and not being able to drive it!
